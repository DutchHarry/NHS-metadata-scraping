It excludes services such as day care, meals, transport and equipment. Clients receiving home care through direct payments are also excluded from the HH1 return. \n For 2004, information was collected on the HH1 form and generally related to the sample week of 13th to 19th September 2004. Some Councils with Social Service Responsibilities (CSSRs) provided information for an alternative week that they considered more representative. \n Details were collected on the number of contact hours of home care and the number of households receiving these services.

"132","GP Earnings and Expenses - 2004-05","This report presents the main results from the GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry for the financial year 2004/05.  \n The report has been agreed by the technical steering committee (TSC), which includes representatives from the four UK health departments, NHS Employers and the BMA. \n The results are based on a sample of 17,897 GPs who report one or more source of self-employment income with accounting year ending in the final quarter (1 January 2005 to 5 April 2005). The data source for the survey is HM Revenue and Customs (HMRCs) tax self-assessment (SA) database. \n Figures relate to earnings, expenses and income derived from all self-employed sources, as reported on tax returns, and so include private as well as NHS work. The figures also include GPs personal earnings that do not contribute towards the NHS Pension Scheme, and will therefore differ to average pensionable earnings figures sourced from the UK pensions agencies. \n This enquiry is the first to be affected by the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract. \n The Information Centre (The IC) has worked with statisticians at Her Majesty&#39;s Revenue and Customs to assess the extent to which the average net income figures in the paper &quot;GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry 2004/05 - Headline Results&quot; are affected by the change in recording practice for the 14 per cent employer&#39;s superannuation contributions in GPs&#39; tax returns.

"133","GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry - 2004-05, Final report","These results are based on a sample of 17,897 GPs who report one or more sources of self-employment income with accounting year ending in the final quarter (1st January 2005 to 5th April 2005). Figures relate to earnings, expenses and income derived from all self-employed sources, as reported on tax returns, and so include private as well as NHS work. However, they do not include earnings from employment (as a salaried employee). All estimates presented in the summary exclude employer&#39;s superannuation contributions and relate to NHS and private work, for both full-time and part-time contractor GPs. Earnings figures relating to salaried GPs are presented separately in Paper H.  \n The data source for the survey is HM Revenue and Customs&#39; (HMRC&#39;s) tax self-assessment (SA) database. Analyses were run on an anonymised dataset by statisticians in HMRC Knowledge, Analysis and Intelligence Information Centre.  \n This enquiry is the first to be affected by the new General Medical Services (nGMS) contract. Consequently, there have been some changes in methodology, which are discussed further in Paper C. For example, in England and Wales, contracted GPs have been identified by considering the proportion of income derived from self employment and employment sources. This could have an effect on results for some of the smaller groups of GPs analysed. \n The Headline Results of the 2004/05 EEQ, published by the Information Centre in November 2006, are superseded by Paper A in this report following adjustment to take account of a technical issue around employer&#39;s superannuation contributions. The Technical Note on Updating of 2004/05 GP EEQ Results was published in April 2007 and has been included as Paper B in this report.  \n This report has been agreed by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which has representation from the four UK Health Departments, NHS Employers and the British Medical Association.

Figures about the percentage of the child population measured per trust, for both reception and year six children were incorrect, along with upper 95 per cent confidence intervals relating to Year 6 obese children.  Figures relating to the proportion of children in each trust who are underweight, a healthy weight, overweight or obese were not affected. National data and all other tables were also unaffected by this issue.  These have now been corrected in both the Annex to the main report and the accompanying excel tables. At the same time some further clarifications have been made to footnotes for Table 5 to clarify that this is based on the postcode of the school the child attended, and to rectify a problem with the Data Quality report which had resulted in the omission of certain Primary Care Trusts.  The NHS Information Centre apologises for any inconvenience caused.  \n Additionally, as a result of detailed validations carried out during production of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) national dataset for Public Health Observatories (PHOs) in January 2011, a local issue affecting the published prevalence rates in Redbridge Primary Care Trust (PCT) (5NA) and Redbridge Local Authority (LA) (00BC) in 2008/09 and 2009/10 has been detected.  Due to the localised and relatively minor nature of the issue, neither the affected NCMP reports nor the accompanying Excel tables available on the website will be amended as a result of this issue. The underlying NCMP datasets made available for further analysis via PHOs, the National Obesity Observatory and UK Data Archive have been amended and so will differ slightly from published data.  Please see the NCMP Issue Notification document available for download above for further information.  \n Summary: \n This report summarises the key findings from the Government&#39;s National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) for England, 2008/09 school year.

The report contains comparisons with 2007/08 and where appropriate comparisons have also been made with 2006/07 results.  This report presents the headline findings for the 2008/09 NCMP. The National Obesity Observatory (NOO) will produce additional analysis in 2010 (expected publication date 30 April 2010), and the anonymised national dataset will be made available to Public Health Observatories (PHOs) to allow regional and local analysis of the data.

This had no effect on the England totals but did have an effect on the England PCT and England LA totals. England LA totals have now decreased by one and England PCT totals have now increased by one. The number of PCTs that processed zero applications have also decreased by one to five as Barking and Dagenham PCT no longer has zero applications processed and now has one against its total.

"192","Trends in Consultation Rates in General Practice - 1995-2006","This paper presents the results of a report commissioned by The Information Centre on behalf of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Department of Health (DH) using QResearch methodology.  \n Both the Department of Health and the Office of National Statistics have adopted the QRESEARCH methodology for estimating primary care consultations in their respective output and productivity calculations. By using actual data from 4m patients the QRESEARCH methodology is seen as more representative of GP consultations than survey data from the previously used General Household Survey. DH first used the data in its 2005/6 cost efficiency estimate to measure progress against its value for money Public Service Agreement (PSA) target. ONS first used the new data in Blue Book 2007 which presents data on UK national accounts.  \n Complete data were available for 100 practices (846,000 patients) in 1995 and for 464 practices (3.9 million registered patients) in 2006. The mean list size per practice in QRESEARCH in 2006 was 8419.  \n Comparisons with the General Household Survey showed similar trends in crude rates by age and sex but the rates in QRESEARCH were lower than those from the General Household Survey. The General Household survey is a patient survey data based on recall of consultations in the last 2 weeks whereas QRESEARCH measures consultations recorded on the GP clinical computer systems.  \n You may also be interested in our  GP Workload Survey  report.

The content and data in the report have not changed in any way. \n This release presents some preliminary results from the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey, covering Northern Ireland, England and Wales. A series of more detailed reports are due to be published in March 2011.  \n The 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey (ADHS) is the fifth in a series of national dental surveys that have been carried out every ten years since 1968.  \n The 2009 survey was commissioned by the NHS Information Centre for health and social care and was conducted on behalf of the Department of Health in England, the Welsh Assembly Health Department, and the Department of Health and Personal Social Services in Northern Ireland. The survey was carried out in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only: Scotland decided not to participate in the 2009 survey.  \n The survey consisted of a questionnaire interview with all adults aged over 16 years at all sampled households, and an oral examination of the mouth and teeth of all those adults who had at least one natural tooth. The survey was managed by the Office for National Statistics working in consortium with the National Centre for Social Research, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and dental experts from the Universities of Birmingham, Cardiff, Dundee, Newcastle, and University College London.  \n The sample size for the survey was 13,400 households (1,150 in each English Strategic Health Authority and Wales, and 750 households in Northern Ireland). Data collection for the survey took place between October 2009 and April 2010, and the final household interview response rate was 60 per cent.  \n A total of 11,380 individuals were interviewed, and 6,469 dentate adults were examined, making this the largest ever epidemiological survey of adult dental health in the United Kingdom.  \n The main purpose of these surveys has been to get a picture of the dental health of the adult population and how this has changed over time.  \n The aims of the survey were to:  \n \n establish the condition of the natural teeth and supporting tissues  \n to investigate dental experiences, knowledge about and attitudes towards dental care and oral hygiene  \n to examine changes over time in dental health, attitudes and behaviour  \n to monitor the extent to which dental health targets set by the Government are being met.  \n This report covers the following topics:  \n \n Loss of all natural teeth  \n Functional dentition - adults with 21 or more teeth  \n Summary of tooth condition  \n Sound and untreated teeth  \n Restored, otherwise sound teeth  \n Decayed or unsound teeth  \n Decay on the crowns of the teeth  \n \n Regular dental attendance  \n Levels of dental anxiety.","January 01, 2009 to December 31, 2009","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=323","December 08, 2010","323","Survey|0/Official statistics","Primary care services"

Comparisons of expenses in 2006/07 and 2007/08 have been made, although a number of factors, highlighted in the Introduction of the report, mean that such comparisons should be made with caution.  \n The NHS IC has also published a separate 2007/08 Dental Earnings and Expenses Report, Northern Ireland, Experimental Statistics; differences in contractual arrangements between Northern Ireland and England and Wales mean that comparisons between the two reports cannot be made.","April 01, 2007 to March 31, 2008","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=369","August 04, 2009","369","Official statistics","Primary care services"

This report looks at equivalent dental activity data under the old and new contractual arrangements.  \n This report measures treatment activity in three ways:  \n \n the percentage of CoTs that contain a particular type of treatment (e.g. 70 per cent of CoTs contained an examination)  \n the number of treatment items in every 100 CoTs (e.g. 120 teeth filled in every 100 CoTs)  \n the average number of items for CoTs containing that treatment (e.g. an average of 2 crowns per CoT for CoTs containing one or more crowns)  \n This report has been produced by The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.

As part of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreement which came into operation on 1st January 2009, the Department of Health (DH) and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry agreed that the DH would review the variation in uptake of selected medicines in the NHS in England.  \n The NHS Information Centre was asked to produce a bulletin looking at variation in the use of these medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. Data on the number of patients being treated is not available and so predicted use (using the average dose and average length of treatment) was compared with observed use. Data on observed use in 2009 was taken from the primary care prescribing data from NHS Prescribing Services and secondary care data provided by IMSHealth.  \n In all 47 medicines in 18 groups, relating to 29 technology appraisals, were considered. For 12 groups a comparison could be made (these are presented in Section 1 of the technology section results). For those appraisals where a valid comparison could not be made (these are presented in Section 2 of the technology results), the reasons why the comparison could not be made are presented along with a series of questions inviting the reader to suggest improvements to the method or data.  \n This is an experimental publication and is the second of a planned annual series. Feedback is requested to help inform how best to estimate uptake to allow meaningful interpretation of any variation across NHS organisations in future.

More information about these issues can be found in the maternity topic paper on  HES Online .  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre began a complete review of the NHS Maternity Statistics publication in December 2007. The review was carried out in the interest of bringing the publication in line with the National Statistics code of practice, supporting the measurement of the maternity indicator from the recent PSA target and continuous improvement of published data within the Health and Social Care Information Centre.  \n The results of this review were published in a public consultation in May 2008 along with a number of proposals for the future direction of the publication. Stakeholders were able to provide feedback via a questionnaire.  \n As a result of the consultation a number of revisions have been made to the publication.

"323","NHS Maternity Statistics - England, 2007-2008","Correction: A minor change was made to Figure 1 (2007-08) (on the 06/07/2009), this is highlighted within the corrected document. \n Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)  contains a wide range of maternity information which has been published annually since 2000-01. This information has historically been reported separately from other HES data because it has a number of unique characteristics and issues which do not affect other aspects of HES data.  \n In December 2007, the Health and Social Care Information Centre began a complete review of the NHS Maternity Statistics publication, in the interest of bringing the publication in line with the National Statistics code of practice, supporting the measurement of the maternity indicator from the recent PSA (Public Service Agreement) target and the continuous improvement of published data within the Health and Social Care Information Centre. As a result of the consultation, a number of revisions were made to the Maternity Statistics publication. Full details of these changes with the full consultation document can be found here. Although issues with maternity data remain (such as poor data quality and coverage), due to changes in methodology, it is now possible (since 2006-07 data) to publish maternity HES data alongside inpatient and outpatient data.  \n As a result of the Maternity Statistics consultation, the Health and Social Care Information Centre agreed to continue to gross HES data using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) birth registration figures, as in previous publications. It was intended that a selection of tables would be grossed for the current maternity publication (2007-08), but due to a number of factors, this has not been the case. Issues that have led to maternity statistics remaining ungrossed are: \n ? a national grossing factor for HES data to ONS registered births would actually lead to a decrease in HES figures: the original purpose of HES data was to allow for shortfalls in the data  ? the grossing factor is 0.984 and so there is little difference between HES data and ONS registered births  ? geographical breakdowns for ONS registered births are unavailable in the format HES data are produced. This means that it would be impossible to gross data of a geographical breakdown below a national level.","April 01, 2007 to March 31, 2008","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=110","April 30, 2009","110","Official statistics","Hospital care"

So we would be grateful if you could email us at  socialcarequeries@ic.nhs.uk  with your views.  \n This report contains the results of a detailed survey of carers in households in 2009/10, commissioned by the Department of Health as part of the Government&#39;s Carers&#39; Strategy programme. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care (NHS IC) undertook responsibility for this survey which was funded by the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions. GfK NOP was commissioned to carry out face-to-face interviews over 11 months of fieldwork in a representative sample of homes in England.  \n The report contains details on the prevalence of caring in England, the demographic profile of carers, the impact of caring duties upon the carer, details of the services carers receive and a profile of the cared for people. Carers who were under 16 years of age were excluded from the Survey of Carers in Households 2009/10, as were people in communal establishments.  \n This will be of interest to all who share the vision and responsibility for implementing the Carers&#39; Strategy, including Central and Local Government, the public sector, third sector organisations, families and communities. These groups will be able to align the results of this survey with the Strategy.  \n Carers were identified via a short screening questionnaire at addresses which were randomly selected from the Postcode Address File (PAF). Carers were defined as those people who identified themselves as having extra responsibilities of looking after someone who has a long-term physical or mental ill health or disability, or problem related to old age. People providing care in a professional capacity were excluded. The main questionnaire, covered in Chapters 3 to 7 of this report, asked a series of detailed questions about the caring role and was concerned only with Carers who also fitted the General Household Survey (GHS) definition of Carers (which excludes those caring as volunteers for a charity or organisation, those caring for someone in an institution, those providing financial support only and those caring for someone with a temporary illness or disability).

"408","National Child Measurement Programme, Results from the 2007-2008 school year","\n This report summarises the key findings from the Government?s National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) 2007/08. The report provides high level analysis of the prevalence of &quot;underweight&quot;, &quot;healthy weight&quot;, &quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;obese&quot; children, in Reception (aged 4?5 years) and Year 6 (aged 10?11 years), measured in the school year 2007/08. Where possible, comparisons have also been made with the 2006/07 NCMP results.  \n When interpreting the results, it is important to consider the possible effects of participation rate on prevalence rates. \n \n \n Since the participation rate was less than 100 per cent, data will be missing for certain children. If these missing data were atypical, results could be biased For example, if children with higher BMI scores opted out of being measured, overweight and obese prevalence would be underestimated.","September 01, 2007 to August 31, 2008","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=1088","December 11, 2008","1088","Official statistics","Public health"

"410","GP Earnings and Expenses - 2003-04","In 2003/04, the average net income for GPMS GPs in Great Britain was &#163;82,019: an increase of 12.8 per cent from 2002/03. Over the same period, GMS GPs saw an increase in average net income of 11.2 per cent compared to an increase of 8.4 per cent for PMS GPs. The combined GPMS increase is higher than both the GMS and PMS increases due to an expanded proportion of higher-earning PMS GPs in the population (from 19 per cent in 2002/03 to 30 per cent in 2003/04). \n \n The average GPMS gross earnings in 2003/04, with associated 95 per cent confidence intervals, were &#163;203,613 &#177; &#163;1,233. The average expenses were &#163;121,595 &#177; &#163;933. \n \n For GPMS GPs with an accounting year-end in quarter 4 the overall expenses to earnings ratio, with associated 95 per cent confidence intervals, was estimated to be 59.7 per cent &#177; 0.2 per cent in 2003/04. This is lower than the ratio for 2002/03, which was 60.5 per cent and reflects the higher increase in gross earnings compared to expenses between 2002/03 and 2003/04. \n \n In 2003/04, PMS net income was 18.8 per cent higher than GMS net income: the corresponding figure in 2002/03 was 21.9 per cent. \n \n In 2003/04, GMS dispensers had a 27 per cent higher net income than GMS non-dispensers; this is unchanged from 2002/03.

"420","GP Earnings and Expenses - 2006-07, Initial report","The latest GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry provides a detailed study of the earnings and expenses of both contractor and salaried GPs in the UK in 2006/07, the third year of the new General Medical Services (nGMS) contract. Investment levels in 2006/07 were similar to 2005/06. Earnings and expenses figures for salaried GPs are provisional at this stage.  \n A further report (the Final Report) containing additional information on earnings and expenses by age of GP, practice size, Government Office Region and rurality, plus final figures for salaried GPs is expected to be published in early 2009.  \n This report has been agreed by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which is chaired by the NHS IC and has representation from the four UK Health Departments, NHS Employers and the British Medical Association.  \n A summary of the data used and analysed in this study is as follows: \n \n earnings and expenses information are based on a sample from HM Revenue and Customs&#39; (HMRC&#39;s) tax self-assessment database, as at May 2008. All analyses are carried out by HMRC statisticians on an anonymised dataset; only aggregate non-disclosive information is supplied to the NHS IC for publication.  \n all UK GPs (working in the NHS) for whom information are available, and who have an accounting year ending in the final quarter (i.e. between 1 January 2007 and 5 April 2007) are included in the sample.  \n figures for contractor GPs are based on their medical income from self-employment sources. Figures for salaried GPs are based on all income from employment sources and medical income from self-employment.  \n the results include earnings and expenses relating to both NHS and private work. It is not possible to provide a NHS/private split using this data source.  \n the results include earnings and expenses for both full-time and part-time GPs  \n the results for contractor GPs exclude an estimate of employer&#39;s superannuation contributions. This estimate will include any Primary Care Organisation (PCO) clawback or reimbursement for previous years (which would have occurred if the GP/PCO had either over or under-estimated predicted earnings for the year).  \n the results for salaried GPs are provisional. This is because we are currently investigating the effect of employee superannuation contributions on the gross earnings and income before tax of salaried GPs. Results for contractor GPs are before deduction of employee superannuation contributions. We will investigate whether it is possible to align the results for contractor and salaried GPs, in time for the Final Report. Comparable figures for earlier years are not available for salaried GPs due to methodological changes.

The genetic nature of many of these diseases means that the relatives of young sudden cardiac death victims are at risk of similar events. In 2004, chapter 8 of the Department of Health?s National Service Framework for coronary heart disease recommended family assessment when a sudden cardiac death occurs in a young person. In response to this challenge, The UK Cardiac Pathology Network (UK CPN) was formed in order to provide local coroners with an expert cardiac pathology service and to promote best pathological practice in sudden death cases. A national database allowing UK CPN pathologists to record information on cases referred to them was launched in November 2008 in partnership with the NHS Information Centre for health and social care (NHS IC) and the Department of Health.

"512","National Kidney Care Audit, Patient Transport Survey - 2010","Renal Replacement Therapy is a life-long treatment for patients with end stage kidney disease. It takes the form either of kidney transplantation or dialysis treatment. Patients can move from dialysis, to having a transplant, and back to dialysis if the kidney transplant fails (and the cycle can be repeated). Dialysis can be divided into two broad modalities: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is a home based therapy, usually administered by the patient with or without the help of a carer. Haemodialysis can also be performed at home, but the overwhelming majority of patients in the UK have their haemodialysis treatment in a dialysis unit. It is this latter group of patients, who have to travel to and from the dialysis unit for their treatment, who are the subject of this patient transport audit. NB - Figures on patient satisfaction in the Executive Summary (last bullet point, p7) were corrected on 14 October 2011 to correct an error in the reporting of these figures (whereby the 2008 comparator figure had incorrectly excluded a category of response).

"526","Evaluation of Standards of Care for Osteoporosis and Falls in Primary Care","In 2007, The Information Centre for health and social care commissioned the first national evaluation of standards of care for osteoporosis and falls in primary care, using the QRESEARCH general practice database. This document reports the findings of the evaluation. The main aims of the project were:  \n \n To conduct the first national evaluation of standards of care in the primary care setting for older people at risk of falls and osteoporotic fractures.  \n To scope the feasibility and implications of including osteoporosis and falls within the Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) in the new GP contract.  \n To advise on the feasibility of extending this evaluation to additional practices in the UK and providing feedback to practices aimed at improving clinical care (ie undertake a full audit cycle).  \n Gradual reductions in bone mass and strength are part of the normal ageing process, but for some individuals the resulting bone fragility (osteoporosis) brings a substantial increase in risk of fragility fractures, particularly in association with a number of well described skeletal and extra-skeletal risk factors. The clinical importance of osteoporosis lies in the resultant fractures most commonly experienced at the hip, wrist and spine.  \n The combined costs of social and hospital care for patients with osteoporotic fractures has been reported as more than &#163;1.8 billion per year in the UK, and are most likely to occur in an older person with osteoporosis who suffers a fall.  \n Fractures in over-60 year olds involve more than two million bed days in England alone, and another two million are taken up by frailty related falls in patients over the age of 75. Half of people suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture can no longer live independently as a result of the injury. Effective medications and lifestyle measures are now available for people with osteoporosis, or at high risk of developing the condition or having a fall.  \n The increasing number of people aged 65 and over will result in a marked increase in prevalence of these conditions. There is new evidence however that people at even the highest risk are unlikely receive optimal care.  \n This new study built on guidance from a number of national bodies, including the Department of Health, NICE and the Royal College of Physicians, aims to determine the best clinical care for osteoporosis and falls within general practice. A set of indicators was developed, similar to those which already exist in the Quality Outcomes Framework for conditions such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. The QRESEARCH database, which collects anonymous electronic medical records from patients in 525 UK general practices, was used to investigate the extent to which:  \n \n information relevant to osteoporosis and falls is currently held in the electronic medical record  \n best practice care for osteoporosis and falls is currently being provided, as shown by the proposed indicators  \n The project has been completed in collaboration with the following:  \n \n University of Nottingham  \n University of Derby  \n Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit, Royal College of Physicians  \n Gloucestershire Primary and Community Care Audit Group  \n Nottinghamshire County Teaching PCT  \n The project has been discussed with and endorsed by the National Osteoporosis Society and its Primary Care Forum as well as the multi-professional Steering Group for the National Audit of Falls and Bone Health hosted by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians. The Health Care Commission and NICE are aware of this project so that it can inform related developments as appropriate.

"527","GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry - 2005-06, Initial results","This report presents the main results from the GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry for the financial year 2005/06. The results for contracted GPs are based on a sample of 17,581 GPs who report one or more sources of self-employment income with accounting year ending in the final quarter (1 January 2006 to 5 April 2006).  \n Figures for contracted GPs relate to earnings, expenses and income derived from all self-employed sources, as reported on tax returns, and so include private as well as NHS work. The results for salaried GPs are based on a sample of 2743 salaried GPs who were identified as being salaried (i.e. submitted a self-assessment tax return for the year 2005/06 and were found to have more income from employment than self-employment). Figures for salaried GPs relate to earnings, expenses and income derived from all employed and self-employed sources, as reported on tax returns, and so include private as well as NHS work.  \n For both full-time and part-time contractor GPs, the results do not include earnings from employment (as a salaried employee) and relate to NHS and private work. The estimates of earnings exclude an estimate of employer&#39;s superannuation contributions in the tax year, which will include any Primary Care Organisation (PCO) clawback for previous years.  \n For salaried GPs the results presented include both full- and part-time GPs, and refer only to those salaried GPs who submitted a self-assessment tax return for the year 2005/06 and have been identified as being salaried (see annex A for further details).  \n The data source for the survey is HM Revenue and Customs&#39; (HMRC&#39;s) tax self-assessment (SA) database and reflects the data held at May 2007. Analyses were run on an anonymised dataset by statisticians in HMRC Knowledge, Analysis and Intelligence.  \n This enquiry is the second to be affected by the new General Medical Services (nGMS) contract. As with the results relating to 2004/05, there have been some changes in methodology compared to that used under the old contract, which are discussed further in annex A.  \n This report has been agreed by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which has representation from the four UK Health Departments, NHS Employers and the British Medical Association. This report presents the initial results for the 2005/06 GP Earnings and Expenses Enquiry, and a more detailed report will be published in due course.  \n For 2005/6, &#163;11,764 has been deducted from average earnings figures for UK GPMS GPs as an estimate of the amount included on tax returns in respect of employer&#39;s superannuation contributions paid in 2005/06. It should be noted that this figure is higher than that deducted in 2004/05, which was &#163;6,234. There are a number of reasons for the &#163;5,530 increase in the adjustment, which include:  \n \n increases in net income  \n wider compliance with HMRC guidance on the tax treatment of superannuation contributions on tax returns  \n clawback by PCOs for superannuation contributions not withheld from global sum payments in 2004/5, because the GP/PCO had underestimated predicted earnings for the year.  \n It is not possible to quantify the relative effects of the different factors. Provided the HMRC guidance for reporting superannuation contributions are, and continue to be, followed at a similar level to 2005/6, there will be no large changes in the average level of the adjustment from improved compliance. Year on year variation in the adjustment will continue to be affected by increases in net income and the effect of clawback.  \n A range of estimates of the effect of pension clawback is given in Annex B. It is possible that the effect of the issues is greater this year than it will be in subsequent years, and it will be necessary to consider future impact once 2006/7 data is available in 2008.

This survey is the third in a series and was conducted by the National Centre for Social Research in collaboration with the University of Leicester for the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.  \n The previous surveys were conducted in 1993 (16-64 year olds) and 2000 (16-74 year olds) by the Office for National Statistics, and covered England, Scotland and Wales.  \n Topics covered:  \n Common mental disorders; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm; Psychosis; Antisocial and borderline personality disorders; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Eating disorder; Alcohol misuse and dependency; Drug use and dependency; Problem gambling; Psychiatric comorbidity  \n The survey used a robust stratified, multi-stage probability sample of households and assesses psychiatric disorder where possible to actual diagnostic criteria.  \n N.B. ALCOHOL CHAPTER: An error in the AUDIT scoring syntax used in the heavy drinking calculation in the Alcohol chapter of the 2007 survey has been identified during the final preparation of the 2014 publication.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. \n ---------- \n Note: \n Following assessment by the United Kingdom Statistics Authority the statistics in NHS Contraceptive Services: England publications were recommended to continue designation as National Statistics subject to a number of requirements being met. \n As part of satisfying these requirements, an updated Data Quality Statement has been issued on 2 April 2012. The revisions include a new ?Relevance&#39; section, further detail on the coverage of the data and how the data are returned, and clarification that many of the initial problems as organisations implemented the SRHAD data collection were resolved before final data were submitted, therefore limiting any affect on the data. \n &#160; \n ---------- \n Summary: \n This annual report presents information on NHS community contraceptive clinics which include family planning clinics and clinics run by voluntary organisations such as Brook Advisory Centres. This data has been collected since 1988-89 through the KT31 return.  \n Information on NHS community contraceptive clinics excludes services provided in out-patient clinics and those provided by General Practitioners. However, limited data is presented for out-patient clinics sourced from The NHS Information Centre&#39;s (NHS IC) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), prescription data and survey data from the ?Contraception and Sexual Health 2008/09&#39; report, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the NHS Information Centre.  \n A new quarterly attendance level collection known as Sexual and Reproductive Health Activity Dataset (SRHAD) started in 2010-11 and it is currently running alongside the KT31 return.  \n For this year&#39;s publication we received data from 166 organisations. 137 of these submitted full year data via KT31, 15 submitted full data via SRHAD, and 14 organisations migrated to SRHAD part way through the year and therefore submitted part year KT31 and part year SRHAD data.  \n Even though the data are collected on a completely different basis (see data quality statement), the mapping and subsequent analysis of the SRHAD data are considered to make them comparable to the KT31 data. There are some data that are not available via SRHAD and these do have an effect on the figures presented (including the totals) but these are considered to have a minimal effect on the figures.

The Safeguards provide a framework for approving the deprivation of liberty for people who lack the capacity to consent to treatment or care in either a hospital or care home that, in their own best interests, can only be provided in circumstances that amount to a deprivation of liberty. The safeguards legislation provides for an assessment process that must be undertaken before deprivation of liberty may be authorised . \n These statistics provide official information about authorisation requests under The Act to deprive adults of their liberty and the outcome of such assessments. The DoLS collection is a statutory collection. All 151 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and 152 Local Authorities (LAs) in England are required to submit a return even if they are only submitting a nil return to inform of no use of the safeguards. \n These statistics provide official information about authorisation requests under The Act to deprive adults of their liberty and the outcome of such assessments. Data is presented by Region (former Government Office Region (GOR)) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) and includes demographic information about people on whose behalf authorisation requests were made. \n The NHS Health and Social Care&#160;Information Centre has moved from quarterly to bi-annual publications, plus an annual publication, in line with the Department of Health&#39;s DoLS publication strategy for 2011/12.

Two IAPT indicators are included in the NHS Operating Framework to measure quarter-on-quarter improvement in: \n \n The proportion of people entering treatment against the level of need in the general population;  \n The proportion of those entering treatment against the number referred.  \n The level of need in the general adult population is known as the rate of prevalence, defined by the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. For common mental health conditions treated in IAPT services, it is expected that a minimum of 15 per cent of those in need would willingly enter treatment if available.  \n Futher guidance ","April 01, 2011 to September 30, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=2576","December 20, 2011","2576","Official statistics","Mental health"

The information presented here refers to exception reporting for indicators with the &#39;clinical domain&#39; of the QOF, and two indicator sets in the &#39;additional services domain&#39; (cervical screening and contraceptive services). \n For background information on QOF exception reporting, and for notes on the way exception reporting rates are calculated, see the detailed notes in the statistical bulletin in QOF exception reporting.","April 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=913","November 16, 2011","913","Official statistics","Primary care services"

"565","Synthetic Estimates of Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours","\n Synthetic estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals (1) have been prepared using 2000-2002 data from the Health Survey for England, the 2001 Census and other information, at the 2003 Census Area Statistics (CAS) ward and Primary Care Organisation (PCO) (2) geographic level for the following variables:  \n \n prevalence of current smoking (at the time the data was collected)  \n obesity of adults  \n binge drinking for adults  \n consumption of five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day (adults)  \n consumption of three or more portions of fruit and vegetables day (children).  \n Guidance on Use and Interpretation   \n These synthetic estimates were produced as part of a research project to test and produce area-level estimates of healthy lifestyle behaviours, which was carried out at the National Centre for Social Research. The estimates were produced in response to the twin requirements to develop small area estimates for Neighbourhood Statistics and to meet local public health information needs.  \n The synthetic estimates are not estimated counts of the number of people or prevalence of a behaviour, e.g. smoking in a ward or PCO. They are estimates based on a model and represent the expected prevalence of a behaviour for any ward or PCO, given the demographic and social characteristics of that area. To interpret the estimates it is recommended that users adopt statements such as &quot;given the characteristics of the local population we would expect a prevalence of approximately x% within PCO X&quot;. \n The synthetic estimates should be considered with their associated Confidence Intervals when making comparisons of one area with another. Although the estimates have large Confidence Intervals (many of which overlap), it is possible to distinguish between those estimates that are significantly different from the national average and those that are not (at both ward and PCO level). The attached charts and User guide show those areas that have estimates significantly above, below or similar to the National estimate. \n The estimates can be used to give an indication of the likely prevalence in an area and an indication of where to target resources. They can be used to examine prevalences in the most disadvantaged areas (e.g. the Spearhead PCOs) as compared with other groups. The estimates should however, not be used for performance monitoring purposes. \n Latest publications   \n The synthetic estimates and associated metadata were published on the Neighbourhood Statistics website , on 29th July 2005, as part of the Health and Care Domain. Further details on the methodology and a user guide are available below: \n Background to Synthetic Estimates \n The Department of Health/HSCIC commissioned the National Centre for Social Research (Natcen) to produce estimates of healthy lifestyle behaviours, using information from the Health Survey for England. The aim of the project was to develop small area estimates for publication on the Neighbourhood Statistics website (this website is designed for users who need local area information to provide key public health information currently not available from any other source. It is managed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) \n A key requirement of the project was to provide robust estimates generated on a consistent basis for all areas of the country, which allow meaningful comparisons within and between local areas. \n Statistical modelling techniques were used to produce the estimates (known as ?synthetic estimates&#39;) because the sample size of national surveys (such as the Health survey for England) is too small to provide reliable estimates. \n Various stakeholders have been involved in the project to produce these estimates, including key policy and analytical stakeholders within DH and the Health and Social Care Information Centre, representatives from the Public Health Observatories providing both a user input and technical expertise, and methodology experts from Natcen, ONS and University academics. Further details of the project are available in the Summary and Technical Reports.","January 01, 2000 to December 31, 2002","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=3355","July 29, 2005","3355","Official statistics","Public health"

The National Audit of Pulmonary Hypertension (NAPH) is a prospective audit of processes and outcomes and has the participation of all eight designated centres. This report of the second year brings together the audit data collected from the nationally designated centres (Table 1). It builds on the first report one year ago1 while expanding new areas of information. Since the last report the lack of completeness of some key data fields has been resolved. Database processes have been kept under constant review and improved. New information has been added to this year?s report about diagnosis, new referrals and survival of selected diagnostic groups of patients. The data presented in this report is for the year from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 and covers all patients seen at the designated centres.

They have been constrained to the Office for National Statistics 2009 mid-year population estimates - based on the 2001 Census, excluding some special populations.

"594","Provisional Accident and Emergency Quality Indicators for England, Experimental statistics by provider for September 2011","In April 2011 a new set of clinical quality indicators was introduced to replace the previous four-hour waiting time standard, and measure the quality of care delivered in A&amp;E departments in England.

"633","Estimating the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Conditions in Adults - Extending the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey","This report presents a new estimate of the prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over. This was derived using data from the  2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS 2007)  in combination with data from a new study of the prevalence of autism among adults with learning disabilities, who are a key group to study because they could not take part in the APMS 2007 and have been found to have an increased risk of autism. \n The study was based on adults with learning disabilities living in private households and communal care establishments in Leicestershire, Lambeth and Sheffield. Whilst the study comprised a relatively small sample with limited geographical coverage and did not include the institutional population, it did include two non-mutually exclusive populations (people in communal care establishments and people with learning disabilities) which were not covered by the APMS 2007. \n The study demonstrates that autism is common among people with a learning disability and, in taking these into account, at 1.1 per cent nationally is slightly higher than the previous estimate of 1.0 per cent in the APMS 2007. Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimates for national prevalence produced by this study were relatively insensitive to inaccuracies caused by the limitations.","October 01, 2006 to April 30, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=4717","January 31, 2012","4717","Survey|0/Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

Overall, a quarter of all&#160;providers listed were affected, ranging from minimal impact on most providers (less than one percentage point variation) to moderate impact on some smaller providers (up to twelve percentage points variation). \n This is the fourth annual publication of the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Attendance data within Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). It covers the period April 2010 to March 2011 and draws on 16.2 million detailed records of attendances at major A&amp;E departments, single specialty A&amp;E departments, minor injuries units and walk-in centres in England. \n Publishing the A&amp;E HES data, as experimental statistics, enables initial conclusions to be presented for discussion and aims to promote and highlight the uses of this potentially rich data set. During the period covered by this publication, not all providers have completed data submissions and data quality is poor in some cases. \n The publication also includes analysis of the A&amp;E HES data compared to the Quarterly Monitoring of Accident and Emergency (QMAE) return, the official source of A&amp;E information, to highlight areas for further investigation. \n NHS organisations can review their own data to ascertain the extent to which their local trend follows the national pattern.

"636","Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services - England, April 2011 to September 2011, Q2, Quarterly report","This quarterly report presents provisional results from the monitoring of the NHS Stop Smoking Services (NHS SSS) in England during the period 1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011. This report includes information on the number of people setting a quit date and the number who successfully quit at the 4 week follow-up. It also presents in depth analyses of the key measures of the service including pregnant women, breakdowns by ethnic groups and type of pharmacotherapy received and regional analyses at Strategic Health Authority (SHA) and Primary Care Trust (PCT) levels. \n Quarterly results from the monitoring of NHS SSS for 2011/12 are provisional and will subsequently be revised to account for any revisions submitted by PCTs throughout the year. At this stage, any comparisons between 2011/12 and earlier years compare provisional figures with final figures. Final figures for 2011/12 will be included in the end of year report, expected to be published in August 2012. \n \n 378,724 people set a quit date through NHS Stop Smoking Services, a increase of 3 per cent (10,493) on the final figure for same period in 2010/11 (368,231), and an increase of 7 per cent (25,449) on the final figure for the same period in 2009/10 (353,275).  \n At the 4 week follow-up 178,986 people had successfully quit (based on self-report), 47% of those setting a quit date. This is a increase of 2 per cent (4,365) on the final figure for the same period in 2010/11 (174,621), and also a increase of 6 per cent (9,786) on the final figure for the same period in 2009/10 (169,200).  \n 73 per cent of successful quitters at the 4 week follow-up had their results confirmed by Carbon Monoxide (CO) verification . This percentage was 69 per cent based on final figures for the same period in 2010/11 and 68 per cent based on final figures for the same period in 2009/10.  \n Of those setting a quit date, success at the four week follow-up increased with age, from 30 per cent of those aged under 18, to 55 per cent of those aged 60 and over.  \n Of the 12,379 pregnant women who set a quit date, 5,318 successfully quit at the four week follow-up (43 per cent).  \n The majority of those setting a quit date received Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) only (64 per cent). A further 26 per cent received varenicline (Champix) only, 1% received bupropion (Zyban) only, 2 per cent received both NRT and varenicline and less than 1 % received both NRT and bupropion. 4 per cent of people setting a quit date did not receive any pharmacotherapy and the type of treatment was unknown for a further 3 per cent.  \n Of those who used varenicline only 59 per cent successfully quit, compared with 52 per cent who received bupropion only, and 43 per cent who received NRT only. 47 per cent of people who did not receive any type of pharmacotherapy successfully quit. (These data should not be used to assess or compare the clinical effectiveness of the various pharmacotherapies as they reflect only the results obtained through the NHS stop smoking services, and are not based on clinical trials. A trained stop smoking advisor discusses and agrees the treatment option with each client.)  \n Total expenditure on NHS Stop Smoking Services was &#163;41.4 million, an increase of 2 per cent (&#163;1.0 million) on the final figure for the same period in 2010/11 (&#163;40.4 million) and an increase of 3 per cent (&#163;1.1 million) on the final figure for the same period in 2009/10 (&#163;40.3 million). The cost per quitter is &#163;231 compared with &#163;232 based on final figures for the same period in 2010/11 and &#163;238 based on final figures for the same period in 2009/10. These figures do not include expenditure on pharmacotherapies.  \n Among Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs), Yorkshire and Humber SHA and South Central SHA reported the highest proportion of successful quitters (53 per cent), while North East SHA and North West SHA reported the lowest success rate (43 per cent).  \n Among Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), Leeds PCT and Warrington PCT reported the highest proportion of successful quitters (69 per cent), while Southwark PCT reported the lowest success rate (30 per cent).  \n For Quarter 2 in 2010/11, the increase between the provisional figures and the final figures was 7.8 per cent for the number setting a quit date and 7.6 per cent for the number of successful quitters (based on self-report). This suggests that the final figures for 2011/12 may be higher than the provisional figures stated above.  \n For Quarter 2 in 2010/11, there was a increase of 0.2 per cent between the provisional and final Quarter 2 expenditure figure.  \n Footnote 1 - Carbon Monoxide (CO) validation measures the level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream and provides an indication of the level of use of tobacco: it is a motivational tool for clients as well as validation of their smoking status. CO validation should be attempted on all clients who self-report as having successfully quit at the 4-week follow-up, except those who were followed up by telephone. \n","April 01, 2011 to September 01, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=4740","January 19, 2012","4740","Official statistics","Public health"

Further details on the background and management of the quality indicators are available from the Department of Health (DH) website.  \n This is the seventh publication of data on the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) clinical quality indicators, drawn from A&amp;E data within provisional Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These data relate to A&amp;E attendances in October 2011 and draw on 1.44 million detailed records of attendances at major A&amp;E departments, single speciality A&amp;E departments (e.g. dental A&amp;Es), minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.  \n This report sets out data coverage, data quality and performance information for the following 5 A&amp;E indicators:  \n \n Left department before being seen for treatment rate  \n Re-attendance rate  \n Time to initial assessment  \n Time to treatment  \n Total time in A&amp;E  \n Publishing these data will help share information on the quality of care of A&amp;E services to stimulate the discussion and debate between patients, clinicians, providers and commissioners, which is needed in a culture of continuous improvement.  \n These A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the shortfalls in the quality and coverage of records submitted via the A&amp;E commissioning data set. The data used in these reports are sourced from Provisional A&amp;E HES data, and as such these data may differ to information extracted directly from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data, or data extracted directly from local patient administration systems. Provisional HES data may be revised throughout the year (for example, activity data for April 2011 may differ depending on whether they are extracted in August 2011, or later in the year). Indicator data published for earlier months have not been revised using updated HES data extracted in subsequent months.  \n The data presented here represent the output of the existing A&amp;E Commissioning Dataset (CDS V6 Type 010). It must be recognised that these data will not exactly match the data definitions for the A&amp;E clinical quality indicators set out in the guidance document A&amp;E clinical quality indicators: Implementation guidance and data definitions (external link). The DH is currently working with Information Standards Board to amend the existing CDS Type 10 Accident and Emergency to collect the data required to monitor the A&amp;E indicators.  \n A&amp;E HES data are collected and published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). The data in this report are secondary analyses of HES data produced by the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team, Department of Health.  \n A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the known shortfalls in the quality of some A&amp;E HES data elements.

The vision for the IAPT programme over the next spending review cycle was set out in the Department of Health publication ?Talking Therapies: A four-year plan of action? and the IAPT KPIs will support measurement of the following objectives: \n 3.2 million people will access IAPT, receiving brief advice or a course of therapy for depression or anxiety disorders;  Access to services will increase and by 2014/15 a minimum of 15 per cent per annum (3.75 per cent per quarter) of those in need will be able to access psychological therapy services;  2.6 million patients will complete a course of treatment;  Up to 1.3 million (50 per cent of those treated) will move to measurable recovery. From quarter one of 2011/12 IAPT KPIs will also be used to support the NHS Operating Framework. Two IAPT indicators are included in the NHS Operating Framework to measure quarter-on-quarter improvement in: \n 1.Number of people entering treatment over the level of need, i.e. the number of people with depression and anxiety disorders in the population;  2.The number of people entering treatment over the number of people with depression and anxiety disorders referred for psychological therapies. The level of need in the general adult population is known as the rate of prevalence, defined by the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. For common mental health conditions treated in IAPT services, it is expected that a minimum of 15 per cent of those in need would willingly enter treatment if available.","July 01, 2011 to December 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=4831","March 13, 2012","4831","Official statistics","Mental health"

"653","Social Care and Mental Health Indicators from the National Indicator Set - 2010-11, Final release","This National Indicator Set (NIS) met the then-government&#39;s commitment, as set out in the local government white paper &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot;, to introduce a clear set of national outcomes and a single set of national indicators by which to measure them. \n For the year 2010-11, the Health and Social Care Information Centre collected information on&#160;eight of the indicators which relate to social care and mental health services. \n The number of social care indicators has been reduced since NIS was introduced. Specifically, four social care indicators reported on in 2009-10 were removed from NIS for 2010-11:  \n \n NI132 - Timeliness of social care assessment  \n NI133 - Timeliness of social care packages following assessment  \n NI128 ? User-reported measure of dignity and respect in their treatment  \n NI136 ? People supported to live independently through social services  \n 2010-11 is the last year of the NIS indicators and the Social Care and Mental Health indicators are being replaced by the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework for 2011-12 onwards. NI125, NI127, NI130, NI145, NI146, NI149 and NI150 will appear in the new framework, although there will be some small changes to the definitions. \n The social care information provided at council level for all councils with Adult Social Services responsibilities (CASSRs) in England and presented in this report is final and relates to the period April 2010 ? March 2011. It supersedes the information published on 21 October 2011. \n The mental health information in this report is supplied by NHS trusts providing specialist mental health services. This report includes final 2010-11 data for the two indicators (NI149 and NI150) that relate to people in contact with secondary Mental Health services. It is a copy of the data published on 21 October 2011 which was already final at the time of release.

A revised report was issued on 5 July 2012. \n This report contains information on staff employed (directly and indirectly) by adult social services departments in England as at September 2011. It will be of interest to central government (for policy development, monitoring and workforce planning), local government (for benchmarking), lobbying organisations, academics and the general public. The report does not include information on staff employed by children&#39;s social services departments which is published by the Department for Education .  \n The report uses data collected by the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care (NMDS-SC). The NMDS-SC is managed by Skills for Care on behalf of the Department of Health and has been collecting information about social care providers and their staff since early 2006.  \n The previous data source used for this report was the Personal Social Services Staff of Social Services Departments return (SSDS001). Following a consultation it was decided that the NMDS-SC would replace the SSDS001 from September 2011 as the adult workforce data return for local authorities.  \n The data in this report are therefore not directly comparable with data from the SSDS001 because the SSDS001 covered both adults and children&#39;s services whereas this report focuses solely on adults and the adult job classifications are very different .

It was intended from the outset that the two achieved samples should be combined during analyses to maximise the sample size within each Primary Care Trust (PCT) in London.  \n There were two main strands to the comparisons carried out in this report:  \n 1.Response differences between the two surveys were examined in terms of the overall response levels of households and individuals, and the amount of missing data items: where respondents had refused or skipped individual questions.  2.The second strand of the analysis was to investigate the effects of measurement error attributable to the different modes of questioning.","January 01, 2006 to December 31, 2006","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=5505","July 01, 2008","5505","Survey|0/Other reports and statistics","Public health"

"683","GP Patient Survey Reports - 2007-08","What is The GP Patient Survey?  The GP Patient Survey (GPPS) was conducted for the second year in 2008. The results of the first survey were published by the Department of Health (DH) in 2007 and may be found on  The Department of Health website  \n The GPPS was commissioned by the DH and was conducted on behalf of the DH by Ipsos-MORI. \n Why do we have The GPPS?  The GPPS was developed to collect information to reward GP practices according to performance on elements of patient access to GP services and choice of hospital services.  \n How is it measured?

It is not about performance management of general practice but about resourcing and then rewarding good practice. \n From April 2006 a revised QOF was introduced, including new clinical areas and revising some clinical indicators. The revised QOF continued to measure achievement against a set of evidence-based indicators, but allowed a possible maximum score of 1,000 points. The reduction from the previous maximum of 1,050 points was due to the reallocation of resources associated with the ?access bonus? (previously 50 QOF points) to become part of an ?access directed enhanced service?. \n The revised QOF measures achievement against 135 indicators and one measure of depth of care, known as holistic care.

"710","Primary Care Trust Prescribing Data - October to December 2011","This release contains data for the quarters April - June 2008 to October to December 2011. Other quarters will be added subsequently. \n Note that there have been changes to PCTs from 1 April 2010. In some cases these are minor changes to names. In such cases the earlier name will be retained for consistency. The PCTs East and North Hertfordshire and West Hertfordshire have merged to form Hertfordshire. Solihull PCT gave up its Care Trust status and changed its PCT code in May 2011 and so there will be a discontinutiy in data between quarters before April 2011 and subsequent data. Some prescriptions will continue to appear for the old PCTs for up to 6 months as prescriptions are valid for that period. \n The data is being made available via NHS iView which will allow users to manipulate and extract data. To use NHS iView you will need to create an account. \n \n Go to NHS iView to see the data \n \n Read the iView Prescribing user guide \n In line with the Making Public Data Public initiative, the data for October to December 2011 is also being made available as a comma separated variable (csv) file. The structure of the file is: \n Quarter \n PCT code \n PCT Name \n BNF section code \n BNF section name \n Items \n Actual Cost \n Net Ingredient Cost  \n Note that the file has column headings and that this is as extracted from ePACT (service provided by Prescription Services) and no changes have been made.

It includes new figures for the fourth quarter of 2011/12 and for 2011/12 as a whole, along with revisions to previous quarters. \n The results provide a measure of the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women at Strategic Health Authority (SHA) and Primary Care Trust (PCT) levels.This supplements the national information available from the quinquennial Infant Feeding Survey (IFS). \n Babies from deprived backgrounds are more likely to be born to mothers who smoke, and to have much greater exposure to secondhand smoke in childhood. Smoking remains one of the few modifiable risk factors in pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious health problems, including lower birth weight, pre-term birth, placental complications and perinatal mortality. \n Reports in the series prior to 2011/12 quarter 3 are available on the  Department of Health Website \n","April 01, 2011 to March 31, 2012","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=7168","May 24, 2012","7168","Official statistics","Public health"
"713","Statistics on Alcohol: England, 2012 ","This statistical report acts as a reference point for health issues relating to alcohol use and misuse, providing information obtained from a number of sources in a user-friendly format. It covers topics such as drinking habits and behaviours among adults (aged 16 and over) and school children (aged 11 to 15), drinking-related ill health and mortality, affordability of alcohol, alcohol related admissions to hospital and alcohol-related costs. The report contains previously published information and also includes additional new analyses.  \n The new analyses are mainly obtained from the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#39;s (HSCIC) Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) system, and Prescribing data. The report also include up to date information on the latest alcohol related government policies and targets and contains links to further sources of useful information.  \n How alcohol-related admissions are calculated:  \n Estimates of the number of alcohol-related admissions to hospital are calculated using a method developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO) which takes information on patients&#39; characteristics and diagnoses from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), together with estimates for the proportion of cases of a particular disease or injury that are caused by alcohol consumption (known as alcohol-attributable fractions (AAFs)).  \n Within this publication, two main measures are presented:  \n \n a broad measure , which is derived by summing the alcohol attributable fraction associated with each admission based on the diagnosis most strongly associated with alcohol out of all diagnoses (both primary and secondary)  \n a narrow measure , which is constructed in a similar way but counts only the fraction associated with the diagnosis in the primary position.

"714","Provisional Accident and Emergency Quality Indicators - England, Experimental statistics by provider for December 2011","\n In April 2011 a new set of clinical quality indicators was introduced to replace the previous four hour waiting time standard, and measure the quality of care delivered in A&amp;E departments in England. Further details on the background and management of the quality indicators are available from the Department of Health (DH) website. This is the ninth publication of data on the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) clinical quality indicators, drawn from A&amp;E data within provisional Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These data relate to A&amp;E attendances in December 2011 and draw on 1.36 million detailed records of attendances at major A&amp;E departments, single speciality A&amp;E departments (e.g. dental A&amp;Es), minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.  \n This report sets out data coverage, data quality and performance information for the following five A&amp;E indicators: \n \n Left department before being seen for treatment rate  \n Re-attendance rate  \n Time to initial assessment  \n Time to treatment  \n Total time in A&amp;E  \n Publishing these data will help share information on the quality of care of A&amp;E services to stimulate the discussion and debate between patients, clinicians, providers and commissioners, which is needed in a culture of continuous improvement. These A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the shortfalls in the quality and coverage of records submitted via the A&amp;E commissioning data set. The data used in these reports are sourced from Provisional A&amp;E HES data, and as such these data may differ to information extracted directly from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data, or data extracted directly from local patient administration systems. Provisional HES data may be revised throughout the year (for example, activity data for April 2011 may differ depending on whether they are extracted in August 2011, or later in the year). Indicator data published for earlier months have not been revised using updated HES data extracted in subsequent months.  \n The data presented here represent the output of the existing A&amp;E Commissioning Dataset (CDS V6 Type 010). It must be recognised that these data will not exactly match the data definitions for the A&amp;E clinical quality indicators set out in the guidance document A&amp;E clinical quality indicators: Implementation guidance and data definitions (external link). The DH is currently working with Information Standards Board to amend the existing CDS Type 10 Accident and Emergency to collect the data required to monitor the A&amp;E indicators.  \n A&amp;E HES data are collected and published by the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care. The data in this report are secondary analyses of HES data produced by the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team, Department of Health.  \n A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the known shortfalls in the quality of some A&amp;E HES data elements. The published information sets out where data quality for the indicators may be improved by, for example, reducing the number of unknown values (e.g. unknown times to initial assessment) and default values (e.g. the number of attendances that are automatically given a time to initial assessment of midnight 00:00).  \n The quality and coverage of A&amp;E HES data have considerably improved over the years, and the Department and the NHS Information Centre are working with NHS Performance and Information directors to further improve the data.  \n Note: \n This information is secondary analysis of HES data that have been produced by the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team in the Department of Health.  \n Questions should be forward to the mailbox of the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team at the Department of Health  urgent&amp;emergencycare@dh.gsi.gov.uk  . \n Revisions Policy: Please note, Provisional HES data may be revised throughout the year (for example data will differ depending on the time at which they were extracted). Indicator data published for earlier months will not be revised using updated HES data extracted in subsequent months.","December 01, 2011 to December 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=7195","April 27, 2012","7195","Official statistics","Hospital care"

"731","National Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome Audit Report - 2011","\n In most middle-aged and older adults, sudden cardiac death is caused by coronary artery disease. In contrast, sudden cardiac death in individuals aged less than 35 years is frequently caused by inherited disorders of cardiac muscle (cardiomyopathies) and cardiac rhythm (ion channelopathies). The genetic nature of many of these diseases means that the relatives of young sudden cardiac death victims are at risk of similar events. In 2004, chapter 8 of the Department of Health?s National Service Framework for coronary heart disease recommended family assessment when a sudden cardiac death occurs in a young person. In response to this challenge, The UK Cardiac Pathology Network (UK CPN) was formed in order to provide local coroners with an expert cardiac pathology service and to promote best pathological practice in sudden death cases. A national database allowing UK CPN pathologists to record information on cases referred to them was launched in November 2008 in partnership with the NHS Information Centre for health and social care (NHS IC) and the Department of Health.

On a national level, wide participation in the audit also provides an overview of the quality of care being provided in England and Wales. \n &#160; \n The National Diabetes Audit analysis is published in the  annual reports . However, easy access is also provided using the NDA Dashboard and  secondary care data tables. \n &#160; \n In additional to the National reports, the NDA has produced PCT/LHB profile reports which present key PCT findings from the 2009-2010 audit onwards in all age groups. The data used to produce the reports is extracted from GP practices in your PCT/LHB and is augmented by secondary care outpatient data and Hospital Episode Statistics on diabetes-related complications. The data is validated, processed and analysed to measure compliance with the National Service Framework (NSF) for Diabetes and NICE quality standards.  \n The analysis contained in the PCT/LHB profile report is benchmarked against the national findings and provides time trend analysis, allowing you to compare care and treatment results to findings. \n * Please note, the 2010 - 2011 report for Cwm Taf LHB is not available due to insufficient practice participation.","January 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=7404","September 28, 2012","7404","Audit|0/Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

"798","National Lung Cancer Audit, Open data ? December 2011","Making clinical audit data transparent \n In his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister restated the commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme.  The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) was identified as the pilot for this data release.  \n These data will be released in an open and standardised format for the first time in December 2011, and provided annually from then onwards.  \n Covering all Cancer Networks and NHS Trusts in England, the data from the audit includes information about data completeness, audit process and outcome measures. The data will be available in a pdf format in the National Lung Cancer Audit 2011 annual report.  \n What information is being made available?  \n \n \n Measures about the process of care given to patients  \n Information about care outcomes and treatment.  \n The data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields; These data do not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data.  \n Using and interpreting the data  \n Data from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care.  \n Data are provided either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2010. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by &#39;place first seen&#39; and cancer networks. The ?place first seen&#39; is the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs).  \n We largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator&#39; for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance. Therefore their performance should not be assessed from the results as published here. These trusts do however fully participate in the audit by providing treatment data for the referring MDTs.  \n The trusts concerned are:  \n \n The Christie NHS Foundation Trust  \n University Hospitals of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust  \n Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology NHS Foundation Trust  \n Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust  \n The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust  \n Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust  \n Accessing the data  \n The data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year two files of data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code.  \n What does the data cover?  \n The data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the NLCA and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for lung cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in appendix 2 of the NLCA report.  \n Are all Trusts included?  \n All Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma are included.  \n What period does the data cover?  \n This data were extracted from the NLCA database in July 2011 and covers patients first seen in the calendar year 2010.

The Safeguards provide a framework for approving the deprivation of liberty for people who lack the capacity to consent to treatment or care in either a hospital or care home that, in their own best interests, can only be provided in circumstances that amount to a deprivation of liberty. The safeguards legislation provides for an assessment process that must be undertaken before deprivation of liberty may be authorised .  \n These statistics provide official information about authorisation requests under The Act to deprive adults of their liberty and the outcome of such assessments.

"806","Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, Key Performance Indicators (IAPT KPIs) - Q3 2011-12 final and Q4 2011-12 provisional","\n The IAPT programme is designed to support the NHS in delivering by 2014/2015: \n \n Evidence-based psychological therapies, as approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), for people with depression and anxiety disorders;  \n Access to services and treatments by people experiencing depression and anxiety disorders from all communities within the local population;  \n Increased health and well-being, with at least 50% of those completing treatment moving to recovery and most experiencing a meaningful improvement in their condition;  \n Patient choice and high levels of satisfaction from people using services and their carers; Timely access, with people waiting no longer than locally agreed waiting times standards; Improved employment, benefit, and social inclusion status including help for people to retain employment, return to work, improve their vocational situation, and participate in the activities of daily living.  \n The vision for the IAPT programme over the next spending review cycle was set out in ?Talking Therapies: A four-year plan of action2? and the IAPT KPIs will support measurement of the following objectives:  \n \n 3.2 million people will access IAPT, receiving brief advice or a course of therapy for depression or anxiety disorders;  \n 2.6 million patients will complete a course of treatment;  \n Up to 1.3 million (50 percent of those treated) will move to measurable recovery. \n From quarter one of 2011/12 IAPT KPIs also support the NHS Operating Framework. Two IAPT indicators are included in the NHS Operating Framework to measure quarter-on-quarter improvement in: \n I. Number of people entering treatment over the level of need, i.e. the number of people with depression and anxiety disorders in the population;  \n II. The number of people entering treatment over the number of people with depression and anxiety disorders referred for psychological therapies. The level of need in the general adult population is known as the rate of prevalence, defined by the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. For common mental health conditions treated in IAPT services, it is expected that a minimum of 15 percent of those in need would willingly enter treatment if available.","October 01, 2011 to March 31, 2012","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=7851","June 19, 2012","7851","Official statistics","Mental health"

"810","Provisional Accident and Emergency Quality Indicators - England, Experimental statistics by provider for February 2012","\n In April 2011 a new set of clinical quality indicators was introduced to replace the previous four hour waiting time standard, and measure the quality of care delivered in A&amp;E departments in England. Further details on the background and management of the quality indicators are available from the Department of Health (DH) website.  \n This is the eleventh publication of data on the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) clinical quality indicators, drawn from A&amp;E data within provisional Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These data relate to A&amp;E attendances in February 2012 and draw on 1.35 million detailed records of attendances at major A&amp;E departments, single speciality A&amp;E departments (e.g. dental A&amp;Es), minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.  \n This report sets out data coverage, data quality and performance information for the following 5 A&amp;E indicators: \n \n Left department before being seen for treatment rate  \n Re-attendance rate  \n Time to initial assessment  \n Time to treatment  \n Total time in A&amp;E  \n Publishing these data will help share information on the quality of care of A&amp;E services to stimulate the discussion and debate between patients, clinicians, providers and commissioners, which is needed in a culture of continuous improvement.  \n These A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the shortfalls in the quality and coverage of records submitted via the A&amp;E commissioning data set. The data used in these reports are sourced from Provisional A&amp;E HES data, and as such these data may differ to information extracted directly from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data, or data extracted directly from local patient administration systems. Provisional HES data may be revised throughout the year (for example, activity data for April 2011 may differ depending on whether they are extracted in August 2011, or later in the year). Indicator data published for earlier months have not been revised using updated HES data extracted in subsequent months.  \n The data presented here represent the output of the existing A&amp;E Commissioning Dataset (CDS V6 Type 010). It must be recognised that these data will not exactly match the data definitions for the A&amp;E clinical quality indicators set out in the guidance document A&amp;E clinical quality indicators: Implementation guidance and data definitions (external link). The DH is currently working with Information Standards Board to amend the existing CDS Type 10 Accident and Emergency to collect the data required to monitor the A&amp;E indicators.  \n A&amp;E HES data are collected and published by the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care. The data in this report are secondary analyses of HES data produced by the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team, Department of Health. A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the known shortfalls in the quality of some A&amp;E HES data elements. The published information sets out where data quality for the indicators may be improved by, for example, reducing the number of unknown values (e.g. unknown times to initial assessment) and default values (e.g. the number of attendances that are automatically given a time to initial assessment of midnight 00:00).  \n The quality and coverage of A&amp;E HES data have considerably improved over the years, and the Department and the NHS Information Centre are working with NHS Performance and Information directors to further improve the data.

An issue has been identified with the methodology we are using to identify deaths that occur in hospital and deaths that occur outside hospital within 30 days of discharge.  \n On the October 2012 release, this figure will be revised to approximately 74.1 per cent and 25.9 per cent respectively. Changes to previous quarters are similar.

There is a methodological change for this publication. Further details of this change can be found on the methodological changes page, under Indicators.  \n There are now 143 providers being reported on the SHMI compared to 147 previously. This is due to trust mergers. The details of the mergers including the associated provider codes are below: \n \n Barts Health NHS Trust (R1H) is a new trust that has been formed from the merger of Barts and The London NHS Trust (RNJ), Newham University Hospital NHS Trust (RNH) and the Whipps Cross University Hospital NHS Trust (RGC). \n Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust (RM4) has now merged with Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (RW3) and will be reported under Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (RW3) going forwards. \n Winchester and Eastleigh Healthcare NHS Trust (RN1) has now merged with Basingstoke And North Hampshire NHS Foundation Trust (RN5) and will be reported under Basingstoke And North Hampshire NHS Foundation Trust (RN5) going forwards. \n Note: \n Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Healthcare NHS Trust (RCC) and York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (RCB) are still published separately for this publication although they have now consolidated. This is due to the special nature of it not being a merger or direct succession and discussions on how to deal with this were still underway at time of production. The decision to treat this like merger was reached only recently. Therefore, these two providers will be reported under York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (RCB) from the next publication onwards.

"855","Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) - Deaths associated with hospitalisation, England, April 2010 - March 2011, Experimental statistics ","\n Update (May 2012): SHMI figures for York Hospital Foundation Trust published October 2011 \n As a result of a submission error by York Hospital Foundation Trust (YHFT - provider code RCB), some of their data were not included in the analysis. This means that the SHMI figure published for YHFT in October 2011 will be incorrect, and is likely to be under-stated. Figures subsequently published in January 2012 and April 2012 have included the missing data and are not affected.  \n Please take note that the figures for the SHMI publication in October 2011 will not be revised as the national impact of the changes is very limited.  \n We have now published an additional document on our websites,&#160; HES SHMI data guidance  in response to this incident. This guide was produced to help providers understand which HES extracts with the corresponding SUS/HES submission deadlines which will be used for the SHMI publications. \n Update (December 2011): Publication of palliative care contextual indicators  \n To add some context to the interpretation of the SHMI we are publishing palliative care contextual indicators along with their specifications.  \n These indicators report on the proportion of all admitted patients who are coded as receiving palliative care and the proportion of all patient mortalities coded as palliative care across all non-specialist acute providers reported on by the SHMI.  \n This information will soon be published on the IC&#39;s indicator portal alongside the SHMI. In future, these contextual indicators will be published at the same time as the SHMI.  \n The IC welcomes feedback and comments on these contextual indicators.  \n \n \n \n This is the first publication of the Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI). The SHMI is a ratio of the observed deaths in a trust over a period of time divided by the expected number given the characteristics of patients treated by that trust.  \n When it&#39;s published  \n The SHMI is produced and published quarterly by the NHS IC. Production and publication of the SHMI follows the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. The SHMI is being published as ?Experimental Statistics&#39; which are new Official Statistics that are under going review. Like all indicators managed by the NHS IC, the SHMI will be subject to continuous review, using the Indicator Assurance Process. Outputs from these reviews will be reported to the National Quality Board, and will be available on the NHS IC&#39;s website.  \n How it&#39;s calculated  \n The data used to calculate the SHMI is generated from data that Trusts have submitted to SUS (Secondary Uses Services). This data is then processed by the NHS IC to create HES data (Hospital Episode Statistics). Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) death registrations is linked to this HES data in order to capture deaths which occur outside hospitals. It is this linked dataset which is used to construct the SHMI.  \n We expect that the SHMI will need to be interpreted, understood and also reproduced, if necessary, by interested parties. Therefore, the NHS IC has published the specification that details the construction of the SHMI along with related methodological information and details of the development process.  \n How to use the SHMI  \n The SHMI requires careful interpretation, and should not be taken in isolation as a headline figure of trust performance. It is best treated as a ?smoke alarm&#39;. The SHMI is an indication of whether individual trusts are conforming to the national baseline of hospital-related mortality. Mortality within a trust is described as either ?as expected&#39;, ?lower than expected&#39; or ?higher than expected&#39;.  \n Trusts whose SHMI value is ?higher than expected&#39; should follow-up ? investigate to identify any underlying causes why this may be and action changes as appropriate. In addition, lessons could be learnt across the NHS from those trusts whose SHMI value is ?lower than expected&#39;.  \n The SHMI value for each trust is plotted against the trust&#39;s expected number of deaths on ?funnel plots&#39;. If the observed number of deaths falls outside of an expected range the Trust in question will be considered to have a higher or lower SHMI than expected. The range, the extremes of which are called control limits, can be calculated in a variety of ways and are shown on the funnel plots. For the SHMI two options are presented: exact Poisson control limits at a 99.8% level and over dispersion control limits at a 95% level.  \n Who can use SHMI  \n The SHMI can be used locally by individual hospital trusts to assess and investigate their mortality related outcomes. Regulators and commissioning organisations can also use the SHMI to investigate outcomes for Trusts under their jurisdiction. In all of these cases the SHMI should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other indicators and information from other sources (patient feedback, staff surveys and other such material) that together form a holistic view of Trust outcomes and a fuller overview of how Trust processes are impacting on outcomes.  \n While the public and patients will be interested in the SHMI, is not intended primarily for use by patients or the public. Although this information is in the public domain it has not been specifically tailored to be easily accessible for a patient or public audience.

"857","NHS Staff Earnings, Estimates - April-June 2012","\n Based upon payments to staff between April and June 2012 we present estimates of annual basic pay and total earnings for NHS staff groups (excluding GPs and high street dentists). We&#39;ve taken pay data from all NHS organisations using the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) during the period. The methodology used to produce these estimates is available above. \n This is the 22nd quarter of earnings estimates derived from the ESR data warehouse and is the last publication in the current series using the existing methodology. This publication also introduces tables marked provisional and experimental based on the proposed new methodology (see Annex A, B and C in the bulletin). We have also published the response to the public consultation that closed on 29 June 2012. \n \n Read the response to consultation on NHS Staff Earnings publication  \n As expected with provisional data, some figures may be revised prior to the next publication as issues are uncovered and resolved, therefore the statistics using the existing methodology are the definitive earnings figures for this publication. \n This will allow those who depend on the existing figures a little longer to prepare for the new methodology whilst providing the existing figures for immediate use. Part of the rationale is that we do not see the end of the consultation exercise as the end of the development of our publication and this structure provides users of these statistics further chance to enter into dialogue. \n The aim is for the December publication of NHS Staff Earnings estimates to be solely based on the new methodology and to include an historic timeseries.

"886","Use of NICE appraised medicines in the NHS in England - 2010 and 2011, Experimental statistics","\n The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing drugs and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. As part of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreement which came into operation on 1 January 2009, the Department of Health (DH) and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry agreed that the DH would review the variation in uptake of selected medicines in the NHS in England. \n The NHS Information Centre was asked to produce a bulletin looking at variation in the use of these medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. Data on the number of patients being treated is not available and so predicted use (using the average dose and average length of treatment) was compared with observed use. Data on observed use in 2010 and 2011 was taken from the primary care prescribing data from NHS Prescribing Services and secondary care data provided by IMS Health. Several pharmaceutical companies also provided their own data. \n In all 52 medicines in 25 groups, relating to 35 technology appraisals, were considered. For 13 groups a comparison could be made (these are presented in Section 1 of the technology section results). For those appraisals where a valid comparison could not be made (these are presented in Section 2 of the technology results), the reasons why the comparison could not be made are presented along with a series of questions inviting the reader to suggest improvements to the method or data. A third section presents an approach to analysing the use of biologics medicines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis on which we welcome comments. \n The report was amended on 11 December 2012 to include NICE guidance on the use of denosumab for secondary prevention of fractures in osteoporosis (page 53). There are no other changes to the text or figures. \n Have your say \n This is an experimental publication and is the third of a planned annual series.

"897","Quality and Outcomes Framework - 2011-12","The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all GP surgeries in England and is part of the GP contract. \n The QOF was introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. Participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part. Practices score points on the basis of achievement against each indicator, up to a maximum of 1,000 points. Results of GP practices&#39; achievement against the QOF are published each year. \n The QOF is not about performance management, but incentivising and rewarding good practice. For 2011/12, 8,123 GP practices in England are included in the published results, covering almost 100 per cent of registered patients in England. \n The QOF has four main components, known as domains. Each domain consists of a set of measures of achievement, known as indicators, against which practices score points according to their level of achievement. \n \n Clinical domain: 87 indicators across 20 clinical areas (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension). \n Organisational domain: 45 indicators across six organisational areas - records and information; information for patients; education and training; practice management and medicines management. \n Patient care experience domain: one indicator relating to length of consultations. \n Additional services domain: nine indicators across four service areas (cervical screening, child health surveillance, maternity services and contraceptive services) \n \n How is QOF achievement measured? \n Achievement against the QOF is measured by the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health (CfH). QMAS ensures consistency in the calculation of quality achievement and disease prevalence, and is linked to payment systems. QOF information on QMAS is not a comprehensive source of data on quality of care in general practice, but it is potentially a rich and valuable source of such information, providing the limitations of the data are acknowledged. \n The Prescribing and Primary Care team of The NHS Information Centre works on behalf of the Department of Health and in collaboration with CfH to obtain extracts from QMAS to support the publication of the QOF information. \n Further details on how the QOF is measured (e.g. QMAS system; practice list size, patient exceptions etc) can be found in the QOF 2011/12 bulletin.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. \n ---------- \n October 2012 Note \n It has been identified that some of the data received in relation to the NHS Contraception Services: England publication series have been under-reported from 2006-07 to 2010-11 due to a coding error. Nationally this has resulted in first attendances being under-reported by approximately 5 per cent for each of the affected years. The error has been corrected nationally for the 2011-12 publication. Previous publications have not been amended. Please see the errata note for further information. The HSCIC apologises for any inconvenience this may have caused \n ---------- \n This annual report primarily presents information on NHS community contraceptive clinics (family planning clinics and clinics run by voluntary organisations such as Brook Advisory Centres). This has been collected since 1988-89 through the KT31 return. Information on NHS community contraceptive clinics excludes services provided in out-patient clinics and those provided by General Practitioners. However, limited data is presented for out-patient clinics sourced from the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#39;s (HSCIC) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), prescription data from the Prescribing team at the NHS IC, and survey data from ?Contraception and Sexual Health 2008-09&#39;, a report published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).  \n A new quarterly attendance-level collection known as Sexual and Reproductive Health Activity Dataset (SRHAD) started in 2010-11 and it is currently running alongside the KT31 return.  \n For this year&#39;s publication we received data from 171 organisations. 92 of these submitted full year data via KT31, 50 submitted full data via SRHAD, and 22 organisations migrated to SRHAD part way through the year. The remaining 7 organisations submitted SRHAD part year because their services were transferred either to or from another organisation.  \n Even though the data are collected on a completely different basis (see data quality statement), the mapping and subsequent analysis of the SRHAD data are considered to make them comparable to the KT31 data. There are some data that are not available via SRHAD and these do have an effect on the figures presented (including the totals) but these are considered to have a minimal effect on the figures.

The last two years (2008/09 and 2009/10) of each time series were standardised to 2006/07 whereas previous years have been standardised to 2005/06. The data have been removed from the Indicator Portal. The previous series of emergency readmissions indicators, with data to 2008/9, can be accessed through  the  archive . Corrected  indicators, with data to 2009/10, were published during the week commencing 21 November 2011. \n These emergency readmission indicators provide information to help the NHS monitor success in avoiding (or reducing to a minimum) readmission following discharge from hospital. \n Not all emergency readmissions are likely to be part of the originally planned treatment and some may be potentially avoidable. The NHS may be helped to prevent potentially avoidable readmissions by seeing comparative figures and learning lessons from organisations with low readmission rates. \n The indicators presented measure emergency admissions to hospitals in England occurring within 28 days of the last, previous discharge from hospital. \n \n There are five emergency readmissions indicators: fractured proximal femur; hip replacement surgery; hysterectomy; stroke and ?all readmissions&#39; (see Cautionary notes below). \n Data is presented for the period 2000/01 to 2009/10, split by gender where applicable, and by age group for the ?all readmissions&#39; indicator. \n Data is provided for around 700 health and local government organisations in England. \n These indicators were previously published on the  Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators  and are now published on the NHS IC&#39;s Indicator Portal as part of the continuing release of this indicator set. \n Data, along with indicator specifications, providing details of indicator construction, data quality, statistical methods and interpretation considerations, can be accessed on  HSCIC&#39;s Indicator Portal .","April 01, 2000 to March 31, 2010","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=9095","November 08, 2011","9095","Official statistics","Hospital care"

Further details concerning these data sets can be found via the links on the left-hand side. \n Patient level data has been made available for the first time in order to support the existing aggregated PROMs publication. The risk of identifying specific patients has been controlled through banding ages and suppressing information where necessary. The patient level data gives organisations the ability to undertake analysis at a greater level of granularity. Going forward, provisional data will be updated on a quarterly basis until that data year is finalised at which point a final data set will be published. \n Only records that have a completed pre-operative questionnaire, a completed post-operative questionnaire and that are linked to HES are included in the data set. For a record to be included within the data set there must be more than five patients that have undergone the same procedure, have the same gender and fall into the same age banding 1 . Each record will contain the actual pre- and post operative scores from the questionnaires as well as the predicted score from the casemix adjustment. Where a record does not contain a predicted score one or more of the components of the casemix adjustment model may not have been completed either in the pre-operative questionnaire or in the HES record.","April 01, 2009 to March 31, 2012","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=9098","February 09, 2012","9098","Other reports and statistics","Patient experience"
"903","PROMs Special Topic, EQ-5D Descriptive System - 2009-2010","\n This is the third of a series of PROMs special topics produced on a quarterly basis. The data presented is based on 2009-10, the most current version of finalised data. Further details concerning these data sets can be found via the links on the left-hand side. \n The EQ-5D system used in PROMs provides two measures of general pre- and post-operative health, the EQ-5D Descriptive System and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). This quarterly Topic of Interest aims to provide users of the PROMs data with an understanding of the changes in the individual components of the EQ-5D descriptive system score between the pre- and post-operative questionnaires. \n The EQ-5D Descriptive System of health-related quality of life states consists of five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression - each of which can take one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity - no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems - within a particular EQ-5D dimension. In the standard publication these five states are combined using weights to give a single headline index measure which ranges from -0.594 to 1, where 1 is the best possible state of health. However this topic paper focuses on the components prior to conversion into an index. Further information regarding the EQ-5D system can be found on the  EuroQol Group website . \n The &#39;Key Facts&#39; summarise the national level changes in the five EQ-5D index score components whilst the supporting spread sheet allows users to split the components by various dimensions at national level or view components for a chosen organisation.","April 01, 2009 to March 31, 2010","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=9116","May 10, 2012","9116","Other reports and statistics","Patient experience"

It then compares the provision of ill-health prevention advice and interventions and healthcare management between patients with LD and the patient population as a whole.  \n The study shows that access to and quality of health care for patients with LD is broadly similar to that of the general patient population for many of the conditions analysed. However, a number of issues are raised including:  \n \n higher rates of obesity  \n lower rates of contraceptive advice and smear tests  \n higher rates of seizures amongst patients with epilepsy  \n lower rates of antibiotic prescribing for patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection.  \n These may warrant further investigation.","January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2007","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=9486","February 01, 2010","9486","Other reports and statistics","Mental health"

"928","Infant Feeding Survey - UK, 2010","The Infant Feeding Survey has been discontinued. \n View the  Infant Feeding Survey Notice&#160; available from the Related Links section below for more information. \n &#160; \n Note 1: \n Since publication, new files have been uploaded for the Summary and Introduction with an updated coversheet only. Figures remain unchanged. \n &#160; \n Note 2:  \n Following further validation, a couple of changes were needed which meant some findings previously reported in the Infant Feeding Survey 2010: Early Results publication were reported as significant and are now not significant. These related to findings from Tables 4 and 5. These have been corrected in this report, which supersedes those findings from the Early Results. \n &#160; \n Summary: \n The Infant Feeding Survey (IFS) has been conducted every five years since 1975. The 2010 IFS was the eighth national survey of infant feeding practices to be conducted. The main aim of the survey was to provide estimates on the incidence, prevalence, and duration of breastfeeding and other feeding practices adopted by mothers in the first eight to ten months after their baby was born. \n &#160; \n The survey is based on an initial representative sample of mothers who were selected from all births registered during August and October 2010 in the UK. Three stages of data collection were conducted with Stage 1 being carried out when babies were around four to ten weeks old, Stage 2 when they were around four to six months old, and Stage 3 when they were around eight to ten months old. A total of 10,768 mothers completed and returned all three questionnaires. \n &#160; \n A number of new questions were added to the survey in 2010, covering a range of topics including the Healthy Start scheme (a means-tested voucher scheme for pregnant women or mothers with children under 4 years old to help with basic food items), how mothers who had multiple births fed their babies, whether babies were full term or premature, as well as further exploration of the types of problems mothers may have experienced while breastfeeding. \n &#160; \n In addition to the main findings covered in this summary, the findings of logistic regression analysis to help understand the impact of various demographic characteristics and other factors on breastfeeding initiation and prevalence at two and six weeks (based on full term babies) can be found in the Appendices. \n &#160; \n Mothers are continuing to breastfeed for longer with initiation and prevalence rates showing increases over the last twenty years in the UK. Breastfeeding initiation was higher for babies exposed to early skin-to-skin contact and among mothers from certain demographic groups. However, the proportion of mothers following current guidelines on exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby?s life have remained low since 2005 with only one in a hundred mothers following these guidelines. In terms of formula feeding, there has been a considerable increase in the proportion of mothers following recommended guidelines on making up feeds.&#160; Mothers are also introducing solids later.","January 01, 0001 to January 01, 0001","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=9569","November 20, 2012","9569","Survey|0/Official statistics","Public health"

"934","Provisional Accident and Emergency Quality Indicators - England, Experimental statistics by provider for January 2012","\n In April 2011 a new set of clinical quality indicators was introduced to replace the previous four hour waiting time standard, and measure the quality of care delivered in A&amp;E departments in England. Further details on the background and management of the quality indicators are available from the Department of Health (DH) website. This is the tenth publication of data on the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) clinical quality indicators, drawn from A&amp;E data within provisional Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These data relate to A&amp;E attendances in January 2012 and draw on 1.37 million detailed records of attendances at major A&amp;E departments, single speciality A&amp;E departments (e.g. dental A&amp;Es), minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.  \n This report sets out data coverage, data quality and performance information for the following five A&amp;E indicators: \n \n Left department before being seen for treatment rate  \n Re-attendance rate  \n Time to initial assessment  \n Time to treatment  \n Total time in A&amp;E  \n Publishing these data will help share information on the quality of care of A&amp;E services to stimulate the discussion and debate between patients, clinicians, providers and commissioners, which is needed in a culture of continuous improvement.  \n These A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the shortfalls in the quality and coverage of records submitted via the A&amp;E commissioning data set. The data used in these reports are sourced from Provisional A&amp;E HES data, and as such these data may differ to information extracted directly from Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data, or data extracted directly from local patient administration systems. Provisional HES data may be revised throughout the year (for example, activity data for April 2011 may differ depending on whether they are extracted in August 2011, or later in the year). Indicator data published for earlier months have not been revised using updated HES data extracted in subsequent months.  \n The data presented here represent the output of the existing A&amp;E Commissioning Dataset (CDS V6 Type 010). It must be recognised that these data will not exactly match the data definitions for the A&amp;E clinical quality indicators set out in the guidance document A&amp;E clinical quality indicators: Implementation guidance and data definitions (external link). The DH is currently working with Information Standards Board to amend the existing CDS Type 10 Accident and Emergency to collect the data required to monitor the A&amp;E indicators. A&amp;E HES data are collected and published by the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care. The data in this report are secondary analyses of HES data produced by the Urgent &amp; Emergency Care team, Department of Health.  \n A&amp;E HES data are published as experimental statistics to note the known shortfalls in the quality of some A&amp;E HES data elements. The published information sets out where data quality for the indicators may be improved by, for example, reducing the number of unknown values (e.g. unknown times to initial assessment) and default values (e.g. the number of attendances that are automatically given a time to initial assessment of midnight 00:00).  \n The quality and coverage of A&amp;E HES data have considerably improved over the years, and the Department and the NHS Information Centre are working with NHS Performance and Information directors to further improve the data.

"959","Hospital Episode Statistics, Emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge","\n These emergency readmission indicators provide information to help the NHS monitor success in avoiding (or reducing to a minimum) readmission following discharge from hospital. \n &#160; \n Not all emergency readmissions are likely to be part of the originally planned treatment and some may be potentially avoidable. The NHS may be helped to prevent potentially avoidable readmissions by seeing comparative figures and learning lessons from organisations with low readmission rates.  \n &#160; \n The indicators presented measure emergency admissions to hospitals in England occurring within 28 days of the last, previous discharge from hospital.  \n - &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  There are five emergency readmissions indicators: fractured proximal femur; hip replacement surgery; hysterectomy; stroke and ?all readmissions?  \n - &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Data is presented for the period 2001/02 to 2010/11, split by gender where applicable, and by age group for the ?all readmissions? indicator  \n - &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Data is provided for around 700 health and local government organisations in England \n &#160; \n These indicators were previously published on the  Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators  and are now published on the NHS IC?s Indicator Portal as part of the continuing release of this indicator set.  \n &#160; \n Data, along with indicator specifications, providing details of indicator construction, data quality, statistical methods and interpretation considerations, can be accessed on The NHS IC&#39;s Indicator Portal: \n Go to the indicators   \n &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  \n Cautionary notes on interpretation \n &#167; &#160;  A number of factors outside the control of hospitals, such as the socio-economic mix of local populations and events prior to hospitalisation, may contribute to the variation shown by the indicators. Differences in case-mix, severity of illness, comorbidities and other potential risk factors also contribute to the variation. \n &#167; &#160;  No attempt has been made to assess whether the readmission was linked to the discharge in terms of diagnosis or procedure.  \n &#167; &#160;  Some emergency readmissions may be potentially avoidable and a result of poor treatment in hospital, or poor or badly organised rehabilitation and support services when a person is transferred home following treatment. This analysis does not attempt to identify whether the emergency readmissions were avoidable. \n &#167; &#160;  ?All readmissions? includes all finished and unfinished continuous inpatient (CIP) spells that are emergency admissions within 0-27 days (inclusive) of the last, previous discharge from hospital, including those where the patient dies, but excluding the following: those with a main specialty upon readmission coded under obstetric or mental health specialties; and those where the readmitting spell has a diagnosis of cancer (other than benign or  in situ ) or chemotherapy for cancer coded anywhere in the spell.  \n &#160;","April 01, 2001 to March 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=10062","December 05, 2012","10062","Official statistics","Hospital care"

The survey is also used to populate some of the measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF). \n Please note: On 18 July 2014, the annex tables for this publication have been updated. The worksheet U3 ?

"992","Health Survey for England - 2011, Health, social care and lifestyles","\n The Health Survey for England (HSE) is part of a programme of surveys commissioned by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. It has been carried out since 1994 by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of NatCen Social Research and the Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL (University College London). The study provides regular information that cannot be obtained from other sources on a range of aspects concerning the public?s health and many of the factors that affect health. The series of Health Surveys for England was designed to monitor trends in the nation?s health, to estimate the proportion of people in England who have specified health conditions, and to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors and combinations of risk factors associated with these conditions. The survey is also used to monitor progress towards selected health targets. \n Each survey in the series includes core questions and measurements (such as blood pressure, anthropometric measurements and analysis of blood and saliva samples), as well as modules of questions on specific issues that vary from year to year. In some years, the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample from a specific population subgroup, such as minority ethnic groups, older people or children; there was no boost in 2011. \n This is the twenty first annual Health Survey for England. All surveys have covered the adult population aged 16 and over living in private households in England. Since 1995, the surveys have included children who live in households selected for the survey; children aged 2-15 were included from 1995, and infants under two years old were added in 2001. Those living in institutions were outside the scope of the survey. This should be borne in mind when considering survey findings, since the institutional population is likely to be older and less healthy than those living in private households.  \n The HSE in 2011 provided a representative sample of the population at both national and regional level. For the general population sample, 8,992 addresses were randomly selected in 562 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to December 2011. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, a random selection was made and a single dwelling unit was included. Where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, again one was selected at random. \n All adults and children in selected households were eligible for inclusion in the survey. Where there were three or more children aged 0-15 in a household, two of the children were selected at random to limit the respondent burden for parents. A nurse visit was arranged for all participants who consented.  \n A total of 8,610 adults and 2,007 children were interviewed. A household response rate of 66per cent was achieved. 5,715 adults and 1,257 children had a nurse visit. It should be noted that, for the first time for several years, there was no child boost sample in 2011. Thus the scope for analyses of some data for children may be limited by relatively small sample sizes. \n The report authors would like to acknowledge with thanks the contribution of the National Obesity Observatory to Chapter 10 on adult obesity.","January 01, 2011 to December 31, 2011","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=10149","December 20, 2012","10149","Survey|0/Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n The HSCIC welcomes feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

The title of this data has now been changed to Net Ingredient Cost and an additional table has been provided showing Defined Daily Doses.  \n &#160; \n Whilst the actual figures for each CCG for Defined Daily Dose compared to the Net Ingredient Cost are very different, the relativities between organisations are similar in either measure for Bupropion Hydrochloride, Celecoxib, Orlistat and Tiagabine.

December 2012","\n \n Summary \n Making clinical audit data transparent  \n In his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister restated the commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) was identified as the pilot for this data release.  \n The data was released in an open and standardised format for the first time in December 2011,&#160;the data has been provided annually from then onwards.  \n Covering all Cancer Networks and NHS Trusts in England, the data from the audit includes information about data completeness, audit process and outcome measures. The data will be available in a pdf format in the National Lung Cancer Audit 2011 annual report.  \n What information is being made available?  \n Measures about the process of care given to patients  \n Information about care outcomes and treatment.  \n The data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields; These data do not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data.  \n Using and interpreting the data  \n Data from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care.  \n Data are analysed either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2011. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not routinely supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by &#39;place first seen&#39; and cancer networks. The ?place first seen&#39; most closely represents the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs).  \n We largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator&#39; for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance.  \n Accessing the data  \n The data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year two files of data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code.  \n What does the data cover?  \n The data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the NLCA and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for lung cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in appendix 2 of the NLCA report.  \n Are all Trusts included?  \n All Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma are included.  \n What period does the data cover?  \n This data were extracted from the NLCA database in July 2012 and covers patients first seen in the calendar year 2011.

The report also uses the latest population figures from the 2011 census.  \n This report therefore contains a reduced set of time series analyses and effectively presents a new baseline for some established measures, particularly those relating to people only in contact with community services.  \n For operational reasons the 2011/12 Bulletin has been published in two parts. The initial publication on February 19th 2013 contained a report and data tables based on national figures. This second release on 30th April 2013 adds organisational level analysis and a machine readable file of underlying data for some useful measures. It also introduces standardised rates of access at Primary Care Trust (PCT) level to specialist mental health services, based on 2011 Census data.  \n The Bulletin is intended to be useful to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n IMPORTANT:  In March 2013 we made some improvements to calculations and derived data items and the way in which time series were presented. Consequently changes were made to five tables; presentation of tables 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1, and an update to a derivation used in the construction of tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 which resulted in an overall difference of 23 in the number of inpatients subject to the Mental Health Act during the year (and in minor differences with quoted figures in the report). \n In April&#160;we&#160;reissued the national level tables in a clearer format following a full review of table design (which will be used going forward). These include the improved derivations used in March, and add an improved derivation to tables 4.1 and 4.2 which result in a 1.5% difference (106,966) in bed days which had gender information recorded,, and a revision has been made to the calculation used to produce crude rates of access to NHS funded inpatient care per 100 mental health service users in table 1.6 (a difference at England level of 0.19).","April 01, 2011 to March 31, 2012","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=11178","February 19, 2013","11178","Official statistics","Mental health"

"1088","National Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome Audit Report - 2012","\n In most middle-aged and older adults, sudden cardiac death is caused by coronary artery disease. In contrast, sudden cardiac death in individuals aged less than 35 years is frequently caused by inherited disorders of cardiac muscle (cardiomyopathies) and cardiac rhythm (ion channelopathies). The genetic nature of many of these diseases means that the relatives of young sudden cardiac death victims are at risk of similar events. In 2004, chapter 8 of the Department of Health?s National Service Framework for coronary heart disease recommended family assessment when a sudden cardiac death occurs in a young person. In response to this challenge, The UK Cardiac Pathology Network (UK CPN) was formed in order to provide local coroners with an expert cardiac pathology service and to promote best pathological practice in sudden death cases. A national database allowing UK CPN pathologists to record information on cases referred to them was launched in November 2008 in partnership with the&#160;Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)&#160;and the Department of Health.

The figures remain unchanged. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. \n This statistical report acts as a reference point for health issues relating to alcohol use and misuse, providing information obtained from a number of sources in a user-friendly format. It covers topics such as drinking habits and behaviours among adults (aged 16 and over) and school children (aged 11 to 15), drinking-related ill health and mortality, affordability of alcohol, alcohol related admissions to hospital and alcohol-related costs. The report contains previously published information and also includes additional new analyses.  \n The new analyses are mainly obtained from the Health and Social Care Information Centre&#39;s (HSCIC) Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) system, and prescribing data. The report also includes up to date information on the latest alcohol related government policies and ambitions and contains links to further sources of useful information.  \n How alcohol-related admissions are calculated:  \n Estimates of the number of alcohol-related admissions to hospital are calculated using a method developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO) which takes information on patients&#39; characteristics and diagnoses from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), together with estimates for the proportion of cases of a particular disease or injury that are caused by alcohol consumption (known as alcohol-attributable fractions (AAFs)).  \n Within this publication, two main measures are presented:  \n \n a broad measure , which is derived by summing the alcohol attributable fraction associated with each admission based on the diagnosis most strongly associated with alcohol out of all diagnoses (both primary and secondary); and  \n a narrow measure , which is constructed in a similar way but counts only the fraction associated with the diagnosis in the primary position.

March 2015) was set out in ?Talking Therapies: A four-year plan of action?. 1 &#160; \n IAPT KPI?s will support measurement of the following objectives:  \n \n 3.2 million people will access IAPT, receiving brief advice or a course of therapy for depression or anxiety disorders; \n 2.6 million patients will complete a course of treatment; \n up to 1.3 million (50 per cent of those treated) will move to measurable recovery; \n During 2012/13, IAPT KPIs will also be used to support the NHS Operating Framework.  &#160; Two IAPT indicators are included in the NHS Operating Framework to measure quarter on quarter improvement in; &#160; I. The proportion of people entering treatment against the level of need in the general population (the level of prevalence addressed or ?captured? by referral routes), and II. The proportion of people who complete treatment who are moving to recovery &#160; The level of need in the general adult population is known as the rate of prevalence, defined by the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2000. For common mental health conditions treated in&#160; IAPT services, it is expected that a minimum of 15% of those in need would willingly enter treatment if available. &#160; Further Guidance  http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_123759 \n Please note that the machine readable data file for Q3 final 2012/13 was replaced on the 9th January 2014 to correct an error whereby not all PCTs had been included.

It was mandated as a monthly return from 1 April 2012 and collects details of all people accessing these services. Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record level anonymised data from patient-administration systems.  \n &#160; \n This publication comprises national- and provider-level data quality measures of some key data items in the IAPT dataset: postcode; birthdate; gender; ethnicity; general medical practice code; NHS number; religious belief; sexual orientation; presence of a long-term physical health condition; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; Work and Social Adjustment Scale score; appointment type; therapy type; disability. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and  service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n &#160; \n \n Read more about the IAPT dataset  \n The Information Standards Notice for the IAPT data set can be found on the  Information Standards Board website . \n Note that amendments to the construction of some data quality measures, agreed with the Department of Health, have been implemented in this release.

The purpose of the providing these confidence intervals is to assist users with interpretation of the data. \n &#160; \n On 31 March 2011,  Transparency in outcomes: a framework for adult social care  announced the first Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF), covering the year 2011-12. On 30 March 2012, the ASCOF for 2012-13 was published by the Department of Health. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold: \n \n Nationally, the ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use services. \n Locally, one of the key intended uses of the ASCOF is to support councils to improve the services they provide. The framework attempts to support meaningful comparisons between councils, based on the outcomes they deliver for local people, and to help stimulate the sharing of learning and discussions on best practice. \n It is intended that the ASCOF will foster greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of the services they provide. \n The ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are: \n \n Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs. \n Delaying and reducing the need for care and support. \n Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support. \n Safeguarding people whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm. \n This report contains the provisional figures for the 2012-13 ASCOF measures for England (please see Appendix B of the report for information about data quality). It will be superseded by a final set of figures for 2012-13 early in 2014. \n This is the first year for which measures based on the Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England (Carers? Survey) are included. \n Council level data for 2012-13 are available in the above annex files and through the National Adult Social Care Intelligence Service, where council level data for 2011-12 are also provided.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n &#160; \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release.&#160; Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n &#160; \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems. Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms. \n &#160; \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

July 2013, Provisional statistics","\n \n Users need to be aware of intended changes to the presentation of these statistics. For further information please read the &quot;revisions and issues section&quot; on page five of this month&#39;s bulletin. \n &#160; \n This report revises the HEE timeseries figures for South West, Wessex and the three London HEE regions due to reallocation of a few organisations to different regions. This report also revises the Redundancy timeseries figures for every quarter to consistently apply the headcount methodology. Please see further information in the Revisions and Issues section (pages 5 and 6 of the main report). \n &#160; \n Provisional monthly figures for headcount, full time equivalent, role count and turnover of NHS Hospital and Community Health Service (HCHS) staff groups working in England (excluding primary care staff). \n &#160; \n As expected with provisional statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n &#160; \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release.&#160; Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n &#160; \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems. Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms. \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

It was mandated as a monthly return from 1 April 2012 and collects details of all people accessing these services. Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record level anonymised data from patient-administration systems.  \n &#160; \n This publication comprises national- and provider-level data quality measures of some key data items in the IAPT dataset: postcode; birthdate; gender; ethnicity; general medical practice code; NHS number; religious belief; sexual orientation; presence of a long-term physical health condition; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; Work and Social Adjustment Scale score; appointment type; therapy type; disability. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n The Information Standards Notice for the IAPT data set can be found on the Information Standards Board website. Note that amendments to the construction of some data quality measures, agreed with the Department of Health, have been implemented in this release.

All documents have been updated to reflect that this data is now available. \n &#160; \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. \n The Innovation Health and Wealth paper published by the Department of Health in December 2011, set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS.&#160; One of the actions in this paper is to drive compliance with technology appraisals by the publication of information relating to levels of compliance and variation at a local level. The Health and Social Care Information Centre was requested to develop and publish a scorecard on behalf of the Department of Health and the NHS Commissioning Board. \n There is no central collection of data to directly support this, nor is data on the number of patients treated available centrally. Therefore this is an experimental publication, which presents available data from a range of sources and requests comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets. \n The data is presented in the form of an interactive spread-sheet which uses macros to allow users to identify the organisations and interventions they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables and charts to show variation. An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations.  \n -------- \n Please note that the interactive reporting spreadsheet should only be viewed in conjunction with this report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted. \n ------- \n This is supported by additional information in an FAQ format. \n In this third publication, data is shown to June 2013. Additional information has been provided, including links to hospital trust formularies, and trend utilisation data for a number of NICE appraised medicines including those where adoption is supported by the NICE Implementation Collaborative.  \n &#160; \n It is not appropriate to draw conclusions from comparison of the data for 2011 in the first scorecard with that for 2012 in the second publication, nor with data up to June 2013 in this third publication. Additional medicines and additional hospitals trusts have been included in each publication. Many factors may be responsible for any apparent variation including differences in populations served, services provided and changes in clinical practice.

"1243","Quality and Outcomes Framework - 2012-13","\n Practice level information is available on the QOF online database (link above). \n The national Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) was introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. The objective of the QOF is to improve the quality of care patients are given by rewarding practices for the quality of care they provide to their patients. QOF is therefore an incentive payment scheme, not a performance management tool, and a key principle is that QOF indicators should be based on the best available research evidence. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part.  \n Information in this bulletin was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate their QOF achievement. \n The QOF contains four main components, known as domains. The four domains are: Clinical Domain, Organisational Domain, Patient Experience Domain and Additional Services Domain. Each domain consists of a set of achievement measures, known as indicators, against which practices score points according to their level of achievement. The 2012/13 QOF measured achievement against 148 indicators; practices scored points on the basis of achievement against each indicator, up to a maximum of 1,000 points. A list of 2012/13 QOF indicators is provided in the Technical Annex. \n The QOF has undergone some revisions since it was first introduced, with several changes in 2012/13 from 2011/12. Main changes to the QOF at the start of 2012/13 included the retirement of seven indicators (including five from the Quality and Productivity area), releasing 45 points to fund new and replacement indicators; the introduction of nine new NICE recommended clinical indicators, including two new clinical areas (PAD and Osteoporosis) and additional smoking indicators; the introduction of three new organisational indicators for improving Quality and Productivity which focus on accident and emergency attendances; &#160;  sixteen other indicators were replaced, either due to changes to indicator wording or coding/business logic changes or to changes to point values or thresholds. Overall, the maximum QOF score remained at 1,000 points.","April 01, 2012 to March 31, 2013","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=12972","October 29, 2013","12972","Official statistics","Primary care services"

Data were collected via the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) online Omnibus KP90 collection from all organisations in England which provide Mental Health Services and make use of the Mental Health Act 1983 legislation, as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007, and other legislation. This includes high security psychiatric hospitals as well as other NHS service providers and independent hospitals.  \n These statistics are important in monitoring uses of The Act and will be of interest to mental health professionals as well as service users, their families and representative organisations.  \n Significant improvements were made&#160;to these statistics in response to user feedback received during a public consultation on this publication held in early 2012&#160;including refinements to measures and terminology and&#160;redesigned reference tables. We also added&#160;experimental analysis from the Mental&#160;Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) and&#160;police custody databases, to which which have added for this new report.

"1246","NHS Contraceptive Services, England - 2012-13, Community contraceptive clinics","\n August&#160;2014   Note \n Table 11 was corrected on 13 August&#160;2014 as there was an error.&#160; Specifically, the figures for IU devices and IU systems from 2006-07 to 2012-13 had been swapped around.&#160; We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. \n ---------- \n This annual report primarily presents information on NHS community contraceptive clinics (family planning clinics and clinics run by voluntary organisations such as Brook Advisory Centres). This has been collected since 1988-89 through the KT31 return. \n Information on NHS community contraceptive clinics excludes services provided in out-patient clinics and those provided by General Practitioners. However, limited data is presented for out-patient clinics sourced from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), prescription data from the Prescribing team at the HSCIC, and survey data from ?Contraception and Sexual Health 2008-09?, a report published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the HSCIC. \n A quarterly attendance level collection known as Sexual and Reproductive Health Activity Dataset (SRHAD) started in 2010-11 and it is currently running alongside the KT31 return. For this year?s publication, 35 NHS organisations submitted full year data via KT31 and 117 organisations submitted SRHAD data of which 13 were Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), 81 were NHS Trusts, 1 was a Care Trust, 7 were Social Enterprises and 15 were Brook clinics. \n Not all fields that are collected via KT31 are available via SRHAD. Information on Clinic Sessions for people aged under 25 is not available and as the majority of organisations are now returning data via SRHAD are no longer presented. Also, first contacts for women in relation to sterilisation and for men in relation to vasectomy cannot be ascertained via SRHAD. Sterilisations and vasectomies are included in data based on all contacts or on all first contacts, however they are not included in any data that are based on first contacts in relation to contraception for organisations that submitted data via SRHAD, and these data will therefore be under-reported. On the total figures, this will have a negligible effect, but will have a larger effect on the individual data for sterilisations or vasectomies. This has a larger impact this year than last year as more organisations have submitted data via SRHAD this year.  \n Even though the data are collected on a completely different basis (see data quality statement), the mapping and subsequent analysis of the SRHAD data are considered to make them comparable to the KT31 data. There are some data that are not available via SRHAD (mentioned above) and these need to be considered when interpreting the data.","April 01, 2012 to March 31, 2013","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=13248","October 31, 2013","13248","Official statistics","Public health"

On 30 March 2012, the ASCOF for 2012-13 was published by the Department of Health. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold: \n &#160; \n - Nationally, the ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use services.  \n &#160; \n - Locally, one of the key intended uses of the ASCOF is to support councils to improve the services they provide. The framework attempts to support meaningful comparisons between councils, based on the outcomes they deliver for local people, and to help stimulate the sharing of learning and discussions on best practice.  \n &#160; \n - It is intended that the ASCOF will foster greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of the services they provide. \n &#160; \n The ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are: \n &#160; \n - Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs.  \n &#160; \n - Delaying and reducing the need for care and support.  \n &#160; \n - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support.  \n &#160; \n - Safeguarding people whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm. \n &#160; \n This report contains the final figures for the 2012-13 ASCOF measures for England and supersedes the provisional ASCOF release in July 2013.

Response Rates by Council, in which results are displayed as a whole number rather than to one decimal place. Additionally, the column heading for the overall response rates does not make it clear that this is a weighted response rate. \n - U4 ?

"1257","Monthly NHS Hospital and Community Health Service (HCHS) Workforce Statistics in England ? August 2013, Provisional statistics","\n Users need to be aware of intended changes to the presentation of these statistics. For further information please read the &quot;revisions and issues section&quot; on page five of this month&#39;s bulletin. \n &#160; \n Provisional monthly figures for headcount, full time equivalent, role count and turnover of NHS Hospital and Community Health Service (HCHS) staff groups working in England (excluding primary care staff). \n &#160; \n As expected with provisional statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n &#160; \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release.&#160; Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n &#160; \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems. Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms. \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

"1300","Measures from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, England - 2012-13, Final release","On 31 March 2011, &quot;Transparency in outcomes: a framework for adult social care&quot; announced the first Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF), covering the year 2011-12. On 30 March 2012, the ASCOF for 2012-13 was published by the Department of Health. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold:  \n - Nationally, the ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use services.  \n - Locally, one of the key intended uses of the ASCOF is to support councils to improve the services they provide. The framework attempts to support meaningful comparisons between councils, based on the outcomes they deliver for local people, and to help stimulate the sharing of learning and discussions on best practice.  \n - It is intended that the ASCOF will foster greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of the services they provide.  \n The ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are: \n - Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs. \n - Delaying and reducing the need for care and support. \n - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support. \n - Safeguarding people whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting them from avoidable harm. \n This report contains the final figures for all of the 2012-13 ASCOF measures for England. It supersedes the provisional ASCOF release in July 2013 and provides further information to the initial findings on final data published in November 2013. \n A selection of ASCOF measures is commented on in this executive summary. The 2012-13 national values for all the measures are shown in a table in Chapter 2 along with comparisons with 2010-11 and 2011-12, where available.

"1302","Health Survey for England - 2012","\n The Health Survey for England (HSE) is part of a programme of surveys commissioned by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. It has been carried out since 1994 by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of NatCen Social Research and the Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL (University College London). The study provides regular information that cannot be obtained from other sources on a range of aspects concerning the public?s health and many of the factors that affect health. The series of Health Surveys for England was designed to monitor trends in the nation?s health, to estimate the proportion of people in England who have specified health conditions, and to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors and combinations of risk factors associated with these conditions. The survey is also used to monitor progress towards selected health targets. \n &#160; \n Each survey in the series includes core questions and measurements (such as blood pressure, anthropometric measurements and analysis of blood and saliva samples), as well as modules of questions on specific issues that vary from year to year. In some years, the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample from a specific population subgroup, such as minority ethnic groups, older people or children; there was no boost in 2012. \n &#160; \n This is the 22nd annual Health Survey for England. All surveys have covered the adult population aged 16 and over living in private households in England. Since 1995, the surveys have included children who live in households selected for the survey; children aged 2-15 were included from 1995, and infants under two years old were added in 2001. Those living in institutions were outside the scope of the survey. This should be borne in mind when considering survey findings, since the institutional population is likely to be older and less healthy than those living in private households.  \n &#160; \n The HSE in 2012 provided a representative sample of the population at both national and regional level. 9,024 addresses were randomly selected in 564 postcode sectors, issued over twelve months from January to December 2012. Where an address was found to have multiple dwelling units, a random selection was made and a single dwelling unit was included. Where there were multiple households at a dwelling unit, again one was selected at random.  \n &#160; \n All adults and children in selected households were eligible for inclusion in the survey. Where there were three or more children aged 0-15 in a household, two of the children were selected at random to limit the respondent burden for parents. A nurse visit was arranged for all participants who consented.  \n &#160; \n A total of 8,291 adults and 2,043 children were interviewed. A household response rate of 64 per cent&#160;was achieved. 5,470 adults and 1,203 children had a nurse visit. It should be noted that, as in 2011, there was no child boost sample in 2012. Thus the scope for analyses of some data for children may be limited by relatively small sample sizes. \n &#160;","January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2012","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=13887","December 18, 2013","13887","Survey|0/Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

"1321","Use of NICE-appraised Medicines in the NHS in England - 2012, Experimental statistics","Please note: on 7 February 2014 updated versions of the pdf report and the Excel spreadsheet were uploaded to correct under-reporting of the use of medicines in certain medicine groups. National figures have been revised as follows: \n &#160;- Alzheimer?s Disease by five per cent,  &#160;- ADHD by six per cent,  &#160;- Alitretinoin by four per cent,  &#160;- Riluzole by one per cent, &#160;- Exenatide and Liraglutide by less than one per cent.  \n Within these medicine groups, some sub national data is affected more than others. All other elements of the report are unaffected. This was as a result of complications arising from the extraction of data relating to prescriptions issued in hospital and dispensed in the community. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing drugs and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. As part of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreement which came into operation on 1 January 2009, the Department of Health (DH) and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry agreed that the DH would review the variation in uptake of selected medicines in the NHS in England.  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre was commissioned to work with NICE, DH and the Pharmaceutical Industry to produce and publish a report looking at variation in the use of these medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. Data on the number of patients being treated is not available and so estimated predicted use (using the estimated number of patients and the amount of medicine they would be expected to receive) was compared with observed use where possible. Data on observed use was taken from the primary care prescribing data provided by NHS Prescribing Services and secondary care data was provided by IMS Health. Several pharmaceutical companies also provided their own data. \n This report contains a new approach to measure variation in usage of medicines. The variation approach is used to compare changes over time and between organisations and has been adopted to enable a wider range of medicines to be included in the report. It enables those medicines where significant uncertainty remains in establishing an estimate of eligible patient population and/or estimate of usage to be included. \n Both methods report use of medicines under the new NHS structure. The report is factual and does not seek to find reasons for variation in prescribing. \n NHS medicine use for 54 medicines in 28 therapy groups, relating to 47 technology appraisals are included. For 10 groups the estimate approach is used and the variation approach is used for 18 groups.  \n Have your say: This is an experimental publication and is the fourth of a planned annual series. We invite feedback to help inform how best to estimate uptake to allow meaningful interpretation of any variation across NHS organisations in future.

The report does not include information on staff employed in the independent sector (private and voluntary) or children?s social services departments which is published by the Department for Education. \n This report has used data collected by the National Minimum Data Set for Social Care (NMDS-SC) for the past three years (from 2011).

"1343","National Lung Cancer Audit, Open Data - 2013","Making clinical audit data transparent  \n In his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister restated the commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) was identified as the pilot for this data release.  \n The data was released in an open and standardised format for the first time in December 2011, and each year onward, data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \n Covering all Cancer Networks and NHS Trusts in England, the data from the audit includes information about data completeness, audit process and outcome measures. The data will be available in a pdf format with the National Lung Cancer Audit 2012 annual report.  \n What information is being made available?  \n Measures about the process of care given to patients  \n Information about care outcomes and treatment.  \n The data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields. This data does not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data.  \n Using and interpreting the data  \n Data from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care.  \n Data is analysed either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2012. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not routinely supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by &#39;place first seen&#39; and cancer networks. The ?place first seen&#39; most closely represents the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs).  \n We largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator&#39; for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance.  \n Accessing the data  \n The data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year two files of data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code.  \n What does the data cover?  \n The data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the NLCA and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for lung cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in appendix 2 of the NLCA report.  \n Are all Trusts included?  \n All Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with lung cancer (excluding &#160;  mesothelioma) are included. The audit also covers Wales. \n What period does the data cover?

The data labels had been incorrectly re-sorted so that the ?5 to 9? age band was positioned between ?45 to 49? and ?50 to 54?, however, the associated data were not sorted in the same way, therefore the data were labelled incorrectly for age bands ?5 to 9? to ?45 to 49?. \n Issue 2: This affected the age and gender breakdowns for all quarters and years of data. The ?Expected? values for age were presented as the ?Expected? values for gender and vice versa. This did not affect any other columns presented in the data files. \n This indicator has been corrected as of 27th March 2014. \n The NHS Outcomes Framework indicators form part of the NHS Outcomes Framework. These indicators have been designed to provide national-level accountability for the outcomes the NHS delivers and drive transparency, quality improvement and outcome measurement throughout the NHS. They do not set out how these outcomes should be delivered; it is for NHS England to determine how best to deliver improvements by working with Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to make use of the tools at their disposal.  \n The February 2014 release sees the publication of the following new indicators:  \n - 1.4.i and 1.4.ii One- and five-year survival from all cancers \n - 1.4.iii and 1.4.iv One- and five-year survival from breast, lung and colorectal cancer \n - 1.6.iii Five year survival from all cancers in children \n The release also sees the publication of new data points for the following indicators:  \n - 1b Life expectancy at 75 \n - 2.2 Employment of people with long-term conditions \n - 2.5 Employment of people with mental illness \n - 4.5 Patient experience of maternity services \n - 5a Patient safety incidents reported \n - 5b Safety incidents involving severe harm or death \n - 5.4 Incidence of medication errors causing serious harm \n - 5.5 Admissions of full-term babies to neonatal care \n Further, updated values due to the newly implemented European Standard Population (ESP) and rebased Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates (based on 2011 Census) were calculated for the following indicators: \n - 1a Potential years of life lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to healthcare - All \n - 1a.i Potential years of life lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to healthcare - Adults \n - 1a.ii Potential years of life lost (PYLL) from causes considered amenable to healthcare - Children and young people \n - 1.1 Under 75 mortality rate from cardiovascular disease \n - 1.2 Under 75 mortality rate from respiratory disease \n - 1.3 Under 75 mortality rate from liver disease \n - 1.4 Under 75 mortality rate from cancer \n - 1.5 Excess under 75 mortality rate in adults with serious mental illness \n - 2.3.i Unplanned hospitalisation for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions \n - 2.3.ii Unplanned hospitalisation for asthma, diabetes and epilepsy in under 19s \n - 3a Emergency admissions for acute conditions that should not usually require hospital admission \n - 3.2 Emergency admissions for children with lower respiratory tract infections \n Updated values were also calculated for the following indicators due to changes in the calculation methodology: \n - 2 Health-related quality of life for people with long-term conditions \n - 2.1 Proportion of people feeling supported to manage their condition \n - 2.4 Health-related quality of life for carers","April 01, 2003 to March 31, 2013","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=14278","February 25, 2014","14278","Official statistics","Hospital care"

Alcohol ? will move from end May to end June. Drugs ? will move from end November to end March. Obesity ? will stay at end Feb (but 3rd March for 2015). \n One advantage of this change is that the Hospital Admissions data used in the Drugs compendia will now be able to use final data instead of provisional.&#160; A consequence is there will be no drugs compendia in 2015 with the next report being in March 2016.&#160; However, all the other data used in the report will be available from the sources where it is initially published. \n If you have any concerns over these changes then please send an email by 27 February 2015 to  enquiries@hscic.gov.uk  setting out your concerns. \n This statistical report presents a range of information on obesity, physical activity and diet, drawn together from a variety of sources.  \n The topics covered include: \n - Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults and children - Physical activity levels among adults and children - Trends in purchases and consumption of food and drink and energy intake - Health outcomes of being overweight or obese. \n This report contains seven chapters which consist of the following: \n - Chapter 1: Introduction; this summarises government policies, targets and outcome indicators in this area, as well as providing sources of further information and links to relevant documents. \n - Chapters 2 to 6 cover obesity, physical activity and diet and provides an overview of the key findings from these sources, whilst maintaining useful links to each section of these reports. \n - Chapter 7: Health Outcomes; presents a range of information about the health outcomes of being obese or overweight which includes information on health risks, hospital admissions and prescription drugs used for treatment of obesity.  \n - Figures presented in this report have been obtained from a number of sources and presented in a user-friendly format.

"1353","NICE Technology Appraisals in the NHS in England, Innovation Scorecard - to September 2013, Experimental statistics","The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. \n The Innovation Health and Wealth paper published by the Department of Health in December 2011, set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS.&#160; One of the actions in this paper is to drive compliance with technology appraisals by the publication of information relating to levels of compliance and variation at a local level. The Health and Social Care Information Centre was requested to develop and publish a scorecard on behalf of the Department of Health and the NHS Commissioning Board. \n &#160; \n There is no central collection of data to directly support this, nor is data on the number of patients treated available centrally. Therefore this is an experimental publication, which presents available data from a range of sources and requests comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets. \n &#160; \n The data is presented in the form of an interactive spread-sheet which uses macros to allow users to identify the organisations and interventions they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables and charts to show variation. An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive reporting spreadsheet should only be viewed in conjunction with this report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted.   This is supported by additional information in an FAQ format. \n &#160; \n In this fourth publication, data is shown for April to September 2013 where data is available at the time of publication. Annual data from the recently published ?Use of NICE Appraised Medicines in the NHS in England, 2012? report has been included.&#160;  \n &#160; \n In this publication the denominator for part 3 has changed from reporting medicine use by ?FCE bed days?, to reporting by ?FCE days of hospital care? (bed days plus day cases). This is in response to feedback from users.  \n &#160; \n It is not appropriate to draw conclusions from comparison of the data in each scorecard publication. Additional medicines and additional hospitals trusts have been included in each publication. Many factors may be responsible for any apparent variation including differences in populations served, services provided and changes in clinical practice. In addition, where data has been standardised by resident population, data for six months in this publication cannot be compared to data for a whole year (available in previous publications). \n &#160; \n NHS England have produced maps showing additional analysis of the data.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n &#160; \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n &#160; \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems. Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months, reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms.

Index analysis","This topic of interest is based on final 2011-12 data, first published on 15 October 2013.  \n The EQ-5D? Index is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of healthcare as well as in population health surveys.  \n The EQ-5D? Index comprises the following five dimensions:  \n - Mobility \n - Self-care e.g. washing and dressing \n - Usual activities e.g. work, study, housework, family or leisure activities \n - Pain/discomfort \n - Anxiety/depression \n Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his / her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a one-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for five dimensions can be combined in a five-digit number string describing the respondent?s health state, also referred to as the EQ-5D? ?health profile?. EQ-5D? health states are converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called ?social preference weights?) to each of the levels in each dimension. The index can be calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from one, the value for full health (i.e. state 11111).  \n More detailed analysis, broken down by hospital procedures, healthcare Providers and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), is available in the interactive spread sheet below.  \n Any and all copyrights in the EQ-5D? questions, their order, layout and images vest in the EuroQol Group ( http://www.euroqol.org ).

A record will only be produced when this has occurred and there is no record for a zero total. \n \n For each practice in England, the following information is presented at presentation level for each medicine, dressing and appliance, (by presentation name): \n - the total number of items prescribed and dispensed  \n - the total net ingredient cost  \n - the total actual cost  \n - the total quantity \n The data cover NHS prescriptions written in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. The data include prescriptions written by GPs and other non-medical prescribers (such as nurses and pharmacists) who are attached to GP practices. \n \n GP practices are identified only by their national code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the practice code - provides further detail in relation to the practice. \n Presentations are identified only by their BNF code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the BNF code - provides the chemical name for that presentation.","February 01, 2014 to February 28, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=14774","May 30, 2014","14774","Open data","Primary care services"

Specifically 268 maternities had been incorrectly submitted as smoking at the time of delivery instead of not smoking. The following text highlights the changes needed for NHS Wiltshire and Bath, Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire Area Team. These are also footnoted within the relevant tables. The changes needed for England and the South of England are negligible.  \n Table 5: Number of women smoking at time of delivery for NHS Wiltshire CCG in Q4 2013/14 should be 139. The corresponding percentage of women smoking at time of delivery should be 12.3%. Number not smoking at time of delivery should be 992 and the percentage should be 87.6%. \n The corresponding correct figures for Bath, Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire Area Team are 458, 11.9% 3,354 and 87.4%. \n Table 6: Number of women smoking at time of delivery for NHS Wiltshire CCG in 2013/14 should be 584.

It includes revised data for the first, second and third quarters of 2013-14, in addition to new data for quarter 4 and data for the whole year 2013-14. \n The results provide a measure of the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women at Commissioning Region, Area Team and Clinical Commissioning Group level. This supplements the national information available from the quinquennial Infant Feeding Survey (IFS). \n Smoking remains one of the few modifiable risk factors in pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious health problems, including lower birth weight, pre-term birth, placental complications and perinatal mortality. \n Reports in the series prior to 2011-12 quarter 3 are available from the Department of Health website (see below).","April 01, 2013 to March 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=14841","June 19, 2014","14841","Official statistics","Public health"

This is therefore an experimental publication, which makes use of data currently available from a range of sources. The HSCIC and NHS England request comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets and reporting. \n The data are presented in the form of an interactive spread-sheet which uses macros to allow users to identify the organisations and interventions they wish to explore. The data are also presented in tables and charts to show variation. An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive spreadsheet should&#160; be viewed in conjunction with this report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted. Additional information is available in an FAQ format. \n There are a series of publications since January 2013, each includes developments and additional technologies. In this fifth publication, data are shown for April to December 2013 where data are available at the time of publication. \n Developments in this publication include: \n - Revision of Part 2.1 to include more medicines used predominantly in primary care \n - Update of Part 3.2 to include additional medicines used predominantly in secondary care \n - Development of Part 5 to include reporting at Area Team level \n - Methodological change in Part 5 to report data from prescriptions written in hospitals but dispensed in the community within the secondary care data. This is a change from the last publication, where these data were included with the primary care data. \n It is not appropriate to draw conclusions from comparison of the data in each scorecard publication. Additional medicines and additional hospitals trusts have been included in each publication. Many factors may be responsible for any apparent variation including differences in populations served, services provided and changes in clinical practice.  NHS England have released additional data and analysis using maps. Please see the link below.

Service users were sent questionnaires, issued by Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities, in the period January to March 2014 to seek their opinions over a range of outcome areas. \n &#160; \n The survey is designed to cover all service users aged 18 and over in receipt of services funded wholly or in part by Social Services during 2013-14. It seeks to learn more about how effectively services are helping service users to live safely and independently in their own homes, and the impact of services on their quality of life. The survey is also used to populate some of the measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework. \n &#160; \n These statistics provide useful insights into the lives and experiences of the members of our communities who rely on social services. They will be of use not just to people who plan, provide or use services, but also more widely to all those who take an interest in the vital support that social services can provide to some of the most vulnerable in society. \n The information provided in this report is provisional and there will be a more detailed report, including fully validated data, which is due to be published on 9 December 2014. \n &#160; \n Update, 11 July 2014:  The report outlines some data quality issues identified in advance of publication.

"1441","Measures from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, England - 2013-14, Provisional release","On 31 March 2011, Transparency in outcomes: a framework for adult social care announced the first Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF), covering the year 2011-12. On 30 March 2012, the ASCOF for 2012-13 was published by the Department of Health. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold: \n - Nationally, the ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use services.  \n - Locally, one of the key intended uses of the ASCOF is to support councils to improve the services they provide. The framework attempts to support meaningful comparisons between councils, based on the outcomes they deliver for local people and to help stimulate the sharing of learning and discussions on best practice.  \n - It is intended that the ASCOF will foster greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of the services they provide. \n The ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are: \n - Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs. \n - Delaying and reducing the need for care and support. \n - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support. \n - Safeguarding people whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm. \n This report contains the provisional figures for the 2013-14 ASCOF measures for England. It will be superseded by a final set of figures for 2013-14 later in the year. \n A selection of ASCOF measures is commented on in this executive summary. The 2013-14 national values for all the measures are shown in a table in the following Overview section along with comparisons with 2012-13, 2011-12 and 2010-11 where available. Council level data for 2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12 are available on the website of the Health and Social Care Information Centre and through the National Adult Social Care Intelligence Service (NASCIS). The latest ASCOF data can also be found via the HSCIC ASCOF website. Links to NASCIS and the ASCOF website are provided in the resources section of this web page.  \n 2013-14 is the first year to include measure 1I (proportion of people who use services and their carers who reported that they had as much social contact as they would like); data for this measure are already collected as part of the Adult Social Care Survey and Carers?

"1508","National Diabetes Audit - 2012-2013: Report 1, Care Processes and Treatment Targets","\n \n \n \n This national report from the tenth year of the audit presents key findings on key care processes and treatment target achievement rates from 2012-2013 in all age groups in England and Wales. The care processes and treatment target standards are specified in NICE Clinical Guidelines and the NICE Diabetes in Adults Quality Standards. The NDA also reports on the complications of diabetes, mortality and other complications these will be published in report 2 later in the year.  \n Due to the size of this publication, the data have been organised alphabetically by CCG profile and split into several pages, which are linked to below.  \n Earlier this year an issue was identified with approximately 17,000 records out of 2 million submitted nationally to the 2012-2013 National Diabetes Audit which equates to less than 1% of the total submitted overall.&#160; It was found that through an error in the data loading process these records were not included in the final analysis. The technical reason relates to an error in how the records extracted from the GP systems were transformed into the data used for analysis.  \n After investigations we can confirm that although some national results have altered slightly the National Publication has not been materially affected. In some sub-national reports the care process and treatment target percentages have been affected along with participation. The republished information, including national results, can now be found below in the National Diabetes Audit ? 2012-2013: Report 1, Supporting CCG LHB data tables.&#160; The individual CCG reports have not been changed. \n The National Diabetes Audit identified an issue with data supplied to the HSCIC for the 2011-12 Audit, regarding HbA1c (blood glucose) recording across a number of practices. While this did not materially affect the findings in the National report, in November 2014 we removed the CCG level care process and treatment target reports covering potentially affected practices.&#160; The data which was identified in the issue above from the 2011-12 audit was included in 2012-13 Audit CCG reports without a data quality note. The affected reports have been updated with the following data quality note.  \n There has been an issue identified with data supplied to the HSCIC for the 2011-12 Audit, regarding HbA1c (blood glucose) recording across a number of practices in this CCG.&#160; This does not materially affect the findings in the National report.&#160; Caution should be taken when comparing data, for HbA1c and all eight care processes.  \n The issue does not affect the 2012-2013 data and is restricted only to the 2011-2012 data presented in Table 3, Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 in the CCG level reports for those affected.  \n &#160;","January 01, 2012 to March 31, 2013","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=15512","October 01, 2014","15512","Audit","Illnesses and conditions"

The HSCIC and NHS England welcome comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets and reporting. \n The data is presented in the form of two interactive spreadsheets which use macros to allow users to identify the organisations and interventions they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables and charts.&#160; An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive spreadsheets should&#160; be viewed in conjunction with this report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted. \n There are a series of publications since January 2013, each includes developments and additional technologies. In this sixth publication, local data is shown for April 2013 to March 2014. Additional developments in this publication include: The number of medicines and medical technologies included in parts 2 and 3 is increased.  \n Part 5 now shows the utilisation over time for a wider range of medicines at both National and Area Team level. This is presented as both charts and tables, showing relative use by healthcare sector.  \n Map based visualisation is also provided in an accompanying spreadsheet. \n Three of the estimates included in Part 1 have been updated with 2013/14 data, and presented in an additional report. It is intended that the number of estimates included in future versions of the Innovation Scorecard will be expanded substantially.

It was mandated as a monthly return from 1 April 2012 and collects details of all people accessing these services. Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record-level anonymised data from patient-administration systems. \n This publication comprises national and provider level data quality measures of some key data items in the IAPT data set: postcode; birthdate; gender; ethnicity; general medical practice code; NHS number; religious belief; sexual orientation; presence of a long-term physical health condition; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; Work and Social Adjustment Scale score; appointment type; therapy type; disability. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n Amendments to the construction of some of the data quality measures, previously agreed with the Department of Health, continue to be published in this release. These revisions affect the following measures: DQM26 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) Score; DQM27 Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD 7) Score; DQM28 Work and Social Adjustment Scale Score; DQM29 Appointment Type; DQM30 Therapy type. \n The rules for the Data Quality Measures can be found in the Related links section of this publication, and any revisions will be documented. \n General Notes \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre does not presently have permission to hold person-identifiable data. It is therefore only been possible to validate person-identifiable data items such as NHS number, Postcode and Date of Birth by using data items which have been derived from these items (as specified in the validation rules). \n This monthly file also contains activity data detailing the number of referrals received, entering treatment and completing treatment in the month, by CCG of GP Practice for June. \n There is no provisional data for July included in this publication.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) currently collects data from Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs or councils) on Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) at a case level on an annual basis. This information is then published in the annual report ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?. From 2013-14 the annual report is based on record level data, rather than in aggregate form as in previous years.

As a result of this situation, the Department of Health (DH) proposed the introduction of a temporary, voluntary data collection which has been approved by the DH/ADASS Outcomes and Information Development Board ((OIDB) now known as the Data and Outcomes Board) and the HSCIC Programme and Service Delivery Board. This quarterly collection will enable stakeholders to monitor the scale of the Supreme Court judgements? impact on councils in a timely manner, and will allow for any increase in the number of DoL applications to be quantified and evidenced. \n In order to minimise the burden on councils it was agreed that only three data items are to be collected by each council on a quarterly basis including a monthly breakdown, at an aggregate level. The fields to be collected are the number of DoL application requests made, and of these, the number of requests granted and not granted. \n Data will be collected on a quarterly basis, covering the period April 2014 ? September 2015. This release relates to quarter 1 of the collection, which covers 1 April ? 30 June 2014.

This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page. \n This release also includes paper which announces changes to the MHMDS monthly report, following changes made to the dataset to include learning disability services. \n Please note - The Currency and Payment file is designed to be analysed by Care Cluster.&#160; Each measure is shown by the 21 Care Clusters&#160; and by an&#160; ?All? Care Cluster category, which gives the total for all Care Clusters.&#160; Failure to analyse information by the Care Cluster field will result in duplication. \n Following publication of this release, on 28th October 2014 an issue was identified with the July Currency and Pricing file. Due to an error in our automated process, organisation names with commas were split across columns, resulting in figures being out of line of the appropriate column header for these organisations. \n A corrected version of the July 2014 Currency and Pricing .csv was issued on 29th October and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.","July 01, 2014 to August 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=16255","October 24, 2014","16255","Official statistics","Mental health"
"1543","Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England - April 2014 to June 2014","This quarterly report presents provisional results from the monitoring of the NHS Stop Smoking Services in England during the period 1 April 2014 to 30 June 2014. It includes information on the number of people setting a quit date and the number who successfully quit at the 4 week follow-up. It also presents in depth analyses of the key measures of the service including pregnant women and breakdowns by age group, gender, ethnic group and type of pharmacotherapy received and regional analyses at Region and Local Authority (LA) levels. \n Final figures for 2014-15 will be included in the end of year report to be published on 19 August 2015. \n Please note:&#160;  On 17/06/2015, we were made aware of an error in table 16 (?Number who successfully quit, total expenditure and cost per quitter in England, by Region and Local Authority?).&#160; In this table, the number shown as successfully quit (column E) is actually the number attempting to quit.&#160; This incorrect figure is then used to calculate the cost per quitter in the last column of this table (column J).&#160; This error affects the quarterly reports published for 2014/15.&#160; Reports for 2013/14 and earlier are unaffected. \n On average, the number shown as successfully quitting is around twice as high as it should be which causes the cost per quitter to be around half as high as it should be.&#160; However, there is some local area variation and the impact on the cost per quitter column varies from 28 per cent&#160;to 78 per cent for all but one LA. \n A decision has been taken to not correct the table&#160;as all the 2014/15 reports&#160; are provisional and will be superseded by the 2014/15 final report which will be published on 19 August 2015.

Directly age- and sex-standardised rates adjust for this by showing the rate of PROMs-eligible hospital episodes that would occur in a standard population if it were to experience the age- and sex-specific rates of episodes for a given area. This means that areas with different age and sex makeups can be compared directly, with the rates having been adjusted for these factors.  \n The standard population used in this analysis is the 2013 European Standard Population.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) currently collects data from Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs or councils) on Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) at a case level on an annual basis. This information is then published in the annual report ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?. \n &#160; \n Supreme Court judgments handed down on 19 March 2014 have, anecdotally, led to a substantial increase in the number of Deprivation of Liberty (DoL) applications received by councils. As a result of this situation, the Department of Health (DH) proposed the introduction of a temporary, voluntary data collection which has been approved by the DH/ADASS Outcomes and Information Development Board (OIDB) and the HSCIC Programme and Service Delivery Board. This quarterly collection will enable stakeholders to monitor the scale of the Supreme Court judgements? impact on councils in a timely manner, and will allow for any increase in the number of DoL applications to be quantified and evidenced. \n &#160; \n In order to minimise the burden on councils it was decided that only three data items were to be collected by each council on a quarterly basis including a monthly breakdown, at an aggregate level. The fields to be collected are the number of DoL application requests made, and of these, the number of requests granted and not granted. \n &#160; \n Data will be collected on a quarterly basis, covering the period April 2014 ? September 2015. This release relates to quarter 1 of the collection, which covers 1 April ? 30 June 2014, and quarter 2, covering 1 July to 30 September 2014. The data shows the position on 14 October 2014, when the returns were submitted, but which may need to be updated by councils as further applications are completed.

"1565","Monthly Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Data Quality Reports - Final July, final August and provisional September 2014 ","Summary \n The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) dataset is a regular return of data generated by providers of NHS-commissioned IAPT services in England (including services provided by independent organisations). It was mandated as a monthly return from 1 April 2012 and collects details of all people accessing these services. Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record-level anonymised data from patient-administration systems. \n This publication is the first release of data from version 1.5 of the IAPT dataset and comprises national and provider level data quality measures of some key data items in the dataset: NHS number; postcode; gender; ethnicity; code of commissioner; general medical practice code; mental health care cluster; religious belief; sexual orientation; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; appointment type; therapy type; disability; IAPT care pathway end reason; code of IAPT stepped to provider; stepped care intensity delivered; employment status; psychotropic medication use; statutory sick pay indicator; the five component parts of the work and social adjustment score (work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities and relationships); anxiety disorder specific measures; reason for suspension of activity. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n This monthly file also contains activity data detailing the number of referrals received, entering treatment and completing treatment in the month, by CCG of GP Practice for July and August. \n Some changes to the methodology used in this analysis are described in the Methodological Change paper and a Release Note is provided to assist users in interpreting the impact of the changes and to provide a summary of the main data quality issues. The Methodological Change paper and rules for the Data Quality Measures are referenced in the Related Links below.  \n General Notes  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre does not presently have permission to hold person-identifiable data. It is therefore only been possible to validate person-identifiable data items such as NHS number and Postcode by using data items which have been derived from these items (as specified in the validation rules).","July 01, 2014 to September 30, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=16454","November 21, 2014","16454","Official statistics","Mental health"

"1568","Mental Health Bulletin, Annual Report From MHMDS Returns - 2013-14","Note:  \n Following publication of this release,&#160;an issue was identified with Per cent subject to the Mental Health Act calculation in table 2.3 of the National reference tables \n A corrected version of the National reference tables was issued on 24th July 2015 and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. \n This annual report provides a comprehensive picture of people who used adult and older person?s secondary mental health services in 2013-14. This report is based on submissions made to the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) between April 2013 and March 2014. These submissions were made using version 4.1 of the MHMDS, which was mandated in April 2013 as a monthly submission for the first time. This report also uses mid-year population estimates (2013) from the Office for National Statistics. \n For consistency, much of the information produced in this report and reference tables are updates to those produced in last year?s publication, allowing the reader to compare this year?s data to previous years. However, to reflect the changes to NHS commissioning structures, we have replaced our Primary Care Trust (PCT) level analysis with Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level analysis. This means that no time series information is available at CCG level as 2013/14 was the first year these organisations became operational. \n Time series have been maintained at a high level within our reference tables, but in many places have been limited to 2011-12 as the earliest data point. This is because significant changes were made to the MHMDS in this year (moving from version 3.5 to version 4.0) which means that information before this is not directly comparable. \n Demographic analysis (age, gender and ethnicity) is presented for 2013-14 only where numbers allow. The reader is advised to consult previous publications (as appropriate) for historical data. \n To prevent the release of disclosive information, numbers less than five (including zero) are replaced with by a ?*? symbol. All other numbers are rounded to the nearest five, apart from the England totals which are unrounded. Calculated values are based on unrounded numbers but rounded to 1 decimal place to prevent backward calculation. This approach will prevent identification of a person through cross referencing different publications. \n Monthly analyses and associated data quality measures for 2013-14 have already been released as monthly publications.&#160; The Background Quality Report and monthly data quality measures provide relevant information about the quality of the data that is the source for this annual publication.&#160; \n The report also includes experimental analysis through our special topics on length of hospital stay and analysis of Clinician Reported Outcomes Measurements (CROMs) from MHMDS. The CROMs special topic may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking. This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page.","April 01, 2013 to March 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=16495","November 27, 2014","16495","Official statistics","Mental health"

"1582","Personal Social Services: Expenditure and Unit Costs, England - 2013-14, Final release","This summary provides information about the money spent on adult social care by the social services departments of Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs) in England. It contains information taken from CASSR administrative systems used to record personal social services expenditure and income. The data are used by central government for public accountability, policy monitoring and national accounts, and by local authorities to assess their performance in relation to their peers. This report combines data from 152 CASSRs provided via the Personal Social Services: Expenditure and Unit Costs return (PSS-EX1) and relates to the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. Information within this report is based on final data for 2013-14 and supersedes that contained within the provisional report published in September 2014. \n Gross current expenditure[1]&#160; has been quoted within this summary unless otherwise stated. National level information is provided by client type and service area in this summary. Trends are generally shown over a five year period where broadly comparable and a ten year comparison is made in relation to gross current expenditure. Data on grants and unit costs are broadly comparable over a three year period only. Due to changes in the composition of social care funding and expenditure over time, caution should be exercised when considering long term trends. For further information see Appendix B. In order to account for some of these changes, information about expenditure on adult social care between 2008-09 and 2013-14, from sources including CASSRs and the NHS, is provided in Appendix C. \n For 2014-15, the data for the adult social care expenditure report will be sourced from a new data collection;&#160; the Adult Social Care Finance Return (ASC-FR). This collection replaces the existing finance (PSS-EX1) collection as a result of proposals from the Zero Based Review (ZBR). The current activity returns, RAP &amp; ASC-CAR are also being replaced by a new Short and Long Term Support (SALT) collection, again as a result of proposals from the ZBR. They have been developed by stakeholder groups, which included colleagues from&#160; councils. The ASC-FR and SALT collections will both draw on a new Equalities and Classifications Framework (EQ-CL) and will include some bridging data with previous collections to enable time series comparisons for key expenditure data items. \n As this is the last time the report will be based on PSS-EX1 data, The HSCIC has also published an Expenditure and Unit Costs Compendium which provides national data over a ten year period from the PSS-EX1 collection, in an excel format. The data are already in the public domain through the annual publications. These data are from 2003-2004 to 2013-14 and where available provide breakdowns for service and client types. The compendium tables are available, along with our other Appendix tables, via the HSCIC website. \n Footnote \n 1. Gross current expenditure is total cost excluding capital charges, minus all income except client contributions. \n Note:  \n &#160; \n Hackney Council has notified the HSCIC that the &#163;14,332,000 attributed to expenditure from the Supporting People grant for their council was included in error. This figure does not include any social care expenditure, and it is entirely housing related, which is not collected in the PSS-EX1 return. Their Total Net Expenditure should therefore be &#163;74,569,000 for 2013-14. This should be taken into consideration when using these figures at a council level. The impact at a national level is minimal.","April 01, 2013 to March 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=16602","December 09, 2014","16602","","Social care"

The HES-DID linkage provides the ability to undertake national (within England) analysis along acute patient pathways to understand typical imaging requirements for given procedures, and/or the outcomes after particular imaging has been undertaken, thereby enabling a much deeper understanding of outcomes of imaging and to allow assessment of variation in practice. \n This publication aims to highlight to users the availability of this updated linkage and provide users of the data with some standard information to assess their analysis approach against. \n The two data sets have been linked using specific patient identifiers collected in HES and DID. The linkage allows the data sets to be linked from April 2012 when the DID data was first collected; however this report focuses on patients who were present in the either data set in the period 1 April 2013 to 30 March 2014 only.

"1588","Measures from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, England - 2013-14, Final release  ","The Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF) has been published annually since 2010-11, and draws on data from a number of collections. The ASCOF Handbook of Definitions, published by the Department of Health, provides in-depth information on the purpose of the framework, the construction of the constituent measures, and context for their interpretation. The ASCOF is used both locally and nationally to set priorities for care and support, measure progress and strengthen transparency and accountability. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold: &#160; Locally, the ASCOF supports councils to improve the quality of care and support. By providing robust, nationally comparable information on the outcomes and experiences of local people, the ASCOF supports meaningful comparisons between councils, helping to identify priorities for local improvement and stimulating the sharing of learning and best practice. \n ? The ASCOF fosters greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of the services they provide. A key mechanism for this is through councils? local accounts, where the ASCOF is already being used as a robust evidence base to support councils? reporting of their progress and priorities to local people. \n ? Nationally, the ASCOF measures the performance of the adult social care system as a whole and its success in delivering high-quality, personalised care and support. The framework will support Ministers in discharging their accountability to the public and Parliament for the adult social care system and will inform and support national policy development. \n The ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are: \n - Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs. \n - Delaying and reducing the need for care and support. \n - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support. \n - Safeguarding adults whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm. \n This report provides the findings from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF) for the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. It is based on final data and supersedes the provisional ASCOF release in July 2014. \n A number of ASCOF measures are commented on in this executive summary, and a summary of findings is shown in Chapter 2. Council level data, along with regional totals and totals for council types, for 2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12 are available on the website of the Health and Social Care Information Centre and through the National Adult Social Care Intelligence Service (NASCIS). The latest ASCOF data can also be found on the HSCIC ASCOF website, link below.  \n 2013-14 is the first year to include measure 1I (proportion of people who use services and their carers who reported that they had as much social contact as they would like). Data underpinning this measure have been published for years prior to 2013-14 in the Adult Social Care Survey and Carers? Survey publications. \n Please note: on 14 January 2015 the &#39;Time-series of aggregated outcome measures? annex for this publication has been replaced in order to correct the ?Base? column headings for Measure 1B. The HSCIC would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. \n ASCOF Indicator 1J \n The existing ASCOF Indicator 1A (Social Care related Quality of Life) tells us about the current (care-related) quality of life of people using social care.&#160; Following discussions in 2011 at the Outcomes and Information Development Board (OIDB), it was agreed that the Department of Health would commission a research project from the Quality and Outcomes of Person Centred Care Policy Research Unit (QORU) to develop a ?value added? measure of social care-related quality of life.&#160; This indicator, to be known as ASCOF Indicator 1J, will form part of the 2016-17 framework to be published shortly by the Department of Health. \n The summary paper provided below (IIASC Report Summary 2013-14)&#160;therefore seeks to describe: the background, methods and results of the QORU study which produced the calculation needed in constructing this new indicator; the application of this calculation to existing data flows to derive aggregate local authority-level data; and the interpretation of these individual and aggregate measures, again drawing on the QORU study.&#160; Additionally, local authority-level data (based on the 2013-14 Adult Social Care Survey submissions) are provided in the accompanying dataset (IIASC Dataset 2013-14) and it is envisaged that similar datasets will be made available in due course to cover 2014-15 and 2015-16. \n For further details, QORU?s papers detailing the conclusions of the research and development phase of their work can be found via the &#39;Related links&#39; section&#160;below.&#160; Any queries or comments should be directed to  ascof@dh.gsi.gov.uk  in the first instance.","April 01, 2013 to March 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=16655","December 09, 2014","16655","Official statistics","Social care"
"1589","Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey, England - 2013-14, Final release","Please note: on 2 April 2015, the council-level annex tables and report tables and charts for this publication were updated with the following changes: - In the &#39;Council-level annex tables&#39; file, &#39;U4 - Outcome 1A&#39; worksheet, the column heading for the margin of error figures has been corrected (cells H9, N9, T9, Z9 and AF9). - In the &#39;Report tables and charts&#39; file, &#39;Chapter 9&#39; worksheet, the base figure in footnote 2 of Figure 9.3 and the base figure in footnote 2 of Table 9.4 have been corrected (cells A125 and A139). Users are advised to download these revised files to ensure they have the correct data. The HSCIC would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. \n The Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey is an annual survey for England that took place for the fourth time in 2013-14. Service users were sent questionnaires, issued by Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities, in the period January to March 2014 to seek their opinions over a range of outcome areas. \n The survey is designed to cover all service users aged 18 and over in receipt of services funded wholly or in part by Social Services during 2013-14. It seeks to learn more about how effectively services are helping service users to live safely and independently in their own homes, and the impact of services on their quality of life. The survey is also used to populate some of the measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework. \n These statistics provide useful insights into the lives and experiences of the members of our communities who rely on social services. They will be of use not just to people who plan, provide or use services, but also more widely to all those who take an interest in the vital support that social services can provide to some of the most vulnerable in society. \n This report supersedes the provisional report published in July 2014. National level information is provided in this report. Data for all authorities in England are provided in the annex tables. The data are also available in CSV format.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems. Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months, reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms. These statistics relate to the contracted positions within English NHS organisations and may include those where the person assigned to the position is temporarily absent, for example on maternity leave. \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

"1612","NICE Technology Appraisals in the NHS in England, Innovation Scorecard - to June 2014, Experimental statistics  ","The Innovation Scorecard aims to improve transparency within the NHS of what treatments recommended by NICE are available within Trusts and CCGs and at National and Area Team level. It is intended to support monitoring of compliance with NICE Technology Appraisal (TA) recommendations and to assist the NHS in the identification of variation, which can be explained, challenged or acted upon. It is not intended to be used for performance management.  \n &#160; \n The Innovation Health and Wealth Strategy set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS.  \n &#160; \n There is no central collection of data which can directly support the assessment of uptake of NICE recommendations, nor is data on the number of patients treated available. Therefore this is an experimental publication, which makes use of data currently available from a range of sources, both from the NHS and the commercial sector. The HSCIC welcomes comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets and reporting.  \n &#160; \n The data is presented in the form of two interactive spreadsheets which use macros to allow users to identify the organisations, interventions and time periods they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables, charts and mapping to identify trends and variation. A ?How to?? tab on the interactive spreadsheets explains how to use them.  \n &#160; \n An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations.  Please note that the interactive spreadsheets should be viewed in conjunction with the report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted.  \n &#160; \n In addition, an estimates report looks at the use of a range of appraised medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE.  \n &#160; \n Additional information is available in an FAQ format.  \n &#160; \n The first Innovation Scorecard was published in January 2013, using data from 2011. The second publication in June 2013 reported data for 2012. The Innovation Scorecard has since been published on a quarterly basis, showing data for additional quarters since October 2013. It has also developed over this time to include new treatments recommended by NICE and by enhancements to the format and presentation. A key development for this new publication is the inclusion of summary statistics and use of quintile grouping of NHS organisations.  \n &#160; \n Note that due to the size of the spreadsheets, they may take a few moments to open.  \n &#160; \n NHS England have released additional maps. See the link provided below.  \n &#160; \n Please note: On 2 February 2015 an updated version of the interactive spreadsheet, interactive map and utilisation csv data files were uploaded to reflect errors in the data presented for a small number of medicines. There are substantial changes to the data for two of the 92 medicines included, with minor changes to seven.  \n For Botulinum Toxin Type A, secondary care data has been revised in the national and Area Team level data to include Toxin Type A only. Data is now 25 per cent lower overall (from 24,315 to 18,344 DDDs per 100,000 population in quarter 1 2014-15). Data changes range from 57 per cent lower at Derbyshire Area Team to 0 per cent at Cheshire Area Team.  \n For Darbepoetin Alfa, secondary care data has been revised in the national and Area Team level data to correct DDD calculations. Data is 99 per cent lower overall (from 353,043 to 3,972 DDDs per 100,000 population in quarter 1 2014-15). Data changes range by Area Team but most values have changed substantially. Primary care and FP10HP data has not changed.  \n Figures have also slightly changed for Dabigatran Etexilate, Lenalidomide, Peginterferon Alfa 2b, Risedronate Sodium (excludes 30mg), Rivastigmine, Somatropin, and Tobramycin (DPI only). Data for each of these medicines has changed by less than 2 per cent overall, however some data sources and organisations have changed more than others.  \n Full details are provided in the publication report on page 3.

This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking.

Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record-level anonymised data from patient-administration systems. \n This publication comprises national and provider level data quality measures of some key data items in the dataset: NHS number; postcode; gender; ethnicity; code of commissioner; general medical practice code; mental health care cluster; religious belief; sexual orientation; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; appointment type; therapy type; disability; IAPT care pathway end reason; code of IAPT stepped to provider; stepped care intensity delivered; employment status; psychotropic medication use; statutory sick pay indicator; the five component parts of the work and social adjustment score (work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities and relationships); anxiety disorder specific measures; reason for suspension of activity. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n This monthly file also contains activity data detailing the number of referrals received, entering treatment and completing treatment in the month, by Commissioner for October. \n Some changes to the methodology used in this analysis are described in the Methodological Change paper. The Methodological Change paper and rules for the Data Quality Measures are referenced in the Related Links below.  \n General Notes  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre does not presently have permission to hold person-identifiable data.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) currently collects data from Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs or councils) on Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) at a case level on an annual basis. This information is then published in the annual report ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?. \n Supreme Court judgments handed down on 19 March 2014 led to a substantial increase in the number of Deprivation of Liberty (DoL) applications received by councils. As a result of this situation, the Department of Health (DH) introduced a temporary, voluntary data collection which was approved by the DH/ADASS Outcomes and Information Development Board (OIDB) and the HSCIC Programme and Service Delivery Board. This quarterly collection enables stakeholders to monitor the scale of the Supreme Court judgements? impact on councils in a timely manner, and allows for any increase in the number of DoL applications to be quantified and evidenced. \n In order to minimise the burden on councils only three data items are collected by each council on a quarterly basis including a monthly breakdown, at an aggregate level. The fields collected are the number of DoL application requests made, and of these, the number of requests granted and not granted. \n Data is collected on a quarterly basis, covering the period April 2014 ? September 2015. This release relates to quarter 3 of the collection, which covers 1 October ? 31 December 2014, and also includes updated figures for quarter 1(1 April to 30 June 2014) and quarter 2(1 July to 30 September 2014).

These are NHS payments and deductions made through the HSCIC GP Payments system to providers of general practice services in England which are, in the main, GP practices. Only those GP practices and providers of general practice services that received any payments through the payments system are included in the data. \n These payments exclude invoices raised by providers that were paid directly from other sources, for example by NHS England Area Teams or Local Authority Public Health funding. As these payments are, in effect, the bulk of the income (i.e. turnover) of providers, they do not therefore represent their profits as they take no account of the expenditure incurred in delivering services. \n &#160; \n Contacts for queries \n &#160; \n GP practices and other providers of general practice services included within this report should use their usual payments contact for queries on the figures in the first instance. \n The HSCIC welcomes feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems.

"1650","National Lung Cancer Audit, Open Data - 2014","Making clinical audit data transparent \n In his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister restated the commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) was identified as the pilot for this data release. \n The data was released in an open and standardised format for the first time in December 2011, and each year onward, data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \n Covering all Strategic Clinical Networks and NHS Trusts in England, the data from the audit includes information about data completeness, audit process and outcome measures. The data will be available in a pdf format with the National Lung Cancer Audit 2014 annual report.  \n What information is being made available? \n Measures about the process of care given to patients \n Information about care outcomes and treatment. \n The data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields. This data does not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data. \n Using and interpreting the data \n Data from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \n Data is analysed either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2013 (except where noted). As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not routinely supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by &#39;place first seen&#39; and clinical networks. The ?place first seen&#39; most closely represents the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs). \n We largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator&#39; for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance. \n Accessing the data \n The data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year three files of data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. \n What does the data cover? \n The data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the NLCA and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for lung cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in appendix 2 of the NLCA report. \n Are all Trusts included? \n All Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with lung cancer (excluding&#160; mesothelioma) are included. The audit also covers Wales. \n What period does the data cover? \n This data were extracted from the NLCA database in July 2014 and covers patients first seen in the calendar year 2013 (except where noted).","January 01, 2013 to December 31, 2013","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=17371","February 25, 2015","17371","Audit","Illnesses and conditions"

Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record-level anonymised data from patient-administration systems. \n This publication comprises national and provider level data quality measures of some key data items in the dataset: NHS number; postcode; gender; ethnicity; code of commissioner; general medical practice code; mental health care cluster; religious belief; sexual orientation; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; appointment type; therapy type; disability; IAPT care pathway end reason; code of IAPT stepped to provider; stepped care intensity delivered; employment status; psychotropic medication use; statutory sick pay indicator; the five component parts of the work and social adjustment score (work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities and relationships); anxiety disorder specific measures; reason for suspension of activity. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n This monthly file also contains activity data detailing the number of referrals received, entering treatment and completing treatment in the month, by Commissioner for October. \n Some changes to the methodology used in this analysis are described in the Methodological Change paper. The Methodological Change paper and rules for the Data Quality Measures are referenced in the Related Links below.  \n General Notes  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre does not presently have permission to hold person-identifiable data.

This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA).

"1679","Monthly Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Data Quality Reports - Final December and provisional January 2014 ","The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) dataset is a regular return of data generated by providers of NHS-commissioned IAPT services in England (including services provided by independent organisations). It was mandated as a monthly return from 1 April 2012 and collects details of all people accessing these services. Submissions are received by the Health and Social Care Information Centre as record-level anonymised data from patient-administration systems. \n This publication comprises national and provider level data quality measures of some key data items in the dataset: NHS number; postcode; gender; ethnicity; code of commissioner; general medical practice code; mental health care cluster; religious belief; sexual orientation; provisional diagnosis; source of referral; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) score; Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) score; appointment type; therapy type; disability; IAPT care pathway end reason; code of IAPT stepped to provider; stepped care intensity delivered; employment status; psychotropic medication use; statutory sick pay indicator; the five component parts of the work and social adjustment score (work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities and relationships); anxiety disorder specific measures; reason for suspension of activity. These measures are provided as both counts and percentages of all eligible IAPT records and will be of interest to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of Health and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics (e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and their representatives). \n This monthly file also contains activity data detailing the number of referrals received, entering treatment and completing treatment in the month, by Commissioner for October. \n Some changes to the methodology used in this analysis are described in the Methodological Change paper. The Methodological Change paper and rules for the Data Quality Measures are referenced in the Related Links below.  \n General Notes  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre does not presently have permission to hold person-identifiable data. It is therefore only been possible to validate person-identifiable data items such as NHS number and Postcode by using data items which have been derived from these items (as specified in the validation rules). \n From this release onwards the range of Social Phobia Score values that will be considered valid in Data Quality VODIM measures will be 0-68. Previously, for data from July up to and including November 2014, the range of these values considered valid was 0-8. This minor change has been made as result of feedback from providers and will have a minimal impact on one VODIM measure of one field of the dataset. This change will not impact upon the analysis of activity data nor on the calculation of recovery rates as these processes are entirely separate from the VODIM process to which the change is being applied. \n Changes to reporting of monthly IAPT statistics: \n Please note that this release will be the last in this format. In response to user requirements, from April 2015 the monthly IAPT dataset releases will be expanded to include additional data quality metrics, a machine readable file containing over 70 activity measures, a supporting metadata file, and a complementary Executive Summary which will detail key measures and provide some national time series analysis. The monthly spreadsheet containing activity measures will be discontinued but these measures will be included in the suite of activity measures in the machine readable file. \n A methodological change paper has been issued to describe these changes: \n Methodological changes to IAPT reporting","December 01, 2014 to January 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=17581","March 20, 2015","17581","Official statistics","Mental health"

The survey measures changes in oral health since the last survey in 2003, and provides information on the distribution and severity of oral diseases and conditions in 2013.  \n The survey oversampled schools with high rates of free school meal eligibility to enable comparison of children from lower income families* (children eligible for free school meals in 2013) with other children of the same age, in terms of their oral health, and related perceptions and behaviours*.  \n The 2013 survey dental examination was extended so that tooth decay (dental caries) could be measured across a range of detection thresholds. This reflects the way in which the detection and management of tooth decay has evolved towards more preventive approaches to care, rather than just providing treatment for disease. This survey provides estimates for dental decay across the continuum of caries, including both restorative and preventive care needs*.  \n Complementary information on the children&#39;s experiences, perceptions and behaviours relevant to their oral health was collected from parents and 12 and 15 year old children using self-completion questionnaires. The self-completion questionnaire for older children was introduced for the 2013 survey. \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n *In 2013 when this survey took place, a free school meal was a statutory benefit available only to school aged children from families who received other qualifying benefits (such as Income Support). \n *Differences in clinical outcomes between socio-economic groups are likely to reflect different attitudes, behaviours and experiences relevant to oral health that may also be mediated through other demographic characteristics such as ethnicity and country of birth  \n *Estimates from the four detection thresholds measured in the 2013 survey are available in Report 2.

"1695","Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Statistics Monthly Report: Final January and Provisional February","\n \n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (January 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking. This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page.","January 01, 2015 to February 28, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=17721","April 21, 2015","17721","Official statistics","Mental health"

Monthly Summary Statistics - Quarter 4 2014/15 (January to March)","Since 2009, care homes and hospitals have had to seek authorisation from their Local Authority if they need to deprive an individual who lacks capacity of their liberty as part of their care and/or treatment. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) currently collects data from Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs or councils) on Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) at a case level on an annual basis. This information is then published in the annual report ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?. \n &#160; \n Supreme Court judgments handed down on 19 March 2014 led to a substantial increase in the number of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards&#160;(DoLS) applications received by councils. As a result of this situation, the Department of Health (DH) introduced a temporary, voluntary data collection which was approved by the DH/ADASS Outcomes and Information Development Board (OIDB) and the HSCIC Programme and Service Delivery Board. \n &#160; \n This quarterly collection enables stakeholders to monitor the scale of the Supreme Court judgements? impact on councils in a timely manner, and allows for any increase in the number of DoLS applications to be quantified and evidenced. \n &#160; \n In order to minimise the burden on councils only three data items are collected by each council on a quarterly basis including a monthly breakdown, at an aggregate level. The fields collected are the number of DoLS application requests made, and of these, the number of requests granted and not granted. \n &#160; \n Data is collected on a quarterly basis, covering the period April 2014 ? September 2015. This release relates to quarter 4 of the collection, which covers 1 January ? 31 March 2015, and also includes updated figures for quarter 1(1 April to 30 June 2014), quarter 2(1 July to 30 September 2014) and quarter 3 (1 October to 31 December 2014). The data shows the position on 17 April 2015, when the returns were submitted, but which may need to be updated by councils as further applications are completed. A comparison to the 2013-14 ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards? annual report is also included. \n &#160; \n Further details are included in the Resources section below.","April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=17928","May 12, 2015","17928","Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA).

"1730","NICE Technology Appraisals in the NHS in England, Innovation Scorecard - to September 2014, Experimental statistics ","The Innovation Scorecard aims to improve transparency within the NHS of what treatments recommended by NICE are available within Trusts and CCGs and at National and Area Team level. It is intended to support monitoring of compliance with NICE Technology Appraisal (TA) recommendations and to assist the NHS in the identification of variation, which can be explained, challenged or acted upon. It is not intended to be used for performance management.  \n The Innovation Health and Wealth Strategy set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS.  \n There is no central collection of data which can directly support the assessment of uptake of NICE recommendations, nor is data on the number of patients treated available. Therefore this is an experimental publication, which makes use of data currently available from a range of sources, both from the NHS and the commercial sector. The HSCIC welcomes comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets and reporting. \n The data is presented in the form of two interactive spreadsheets which use macros to allow users to identify the organisations, interventions and time periods they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables, charts and maps to identify trends and variation. A ?How to?? tab on the interactive spreadsheets explains how to use them.  \n An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive spreadsheets should be viewed in conjunction with the report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted.  \n In addition, an estimates report looks at the use of a range of appraised medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. \n &#160; \n Please note that an estimate for Alitretinoin was planned for inclusion in this report. However, due to concerns over some of the evidence used as the basis of the estimate, it has been withheld from publication. NICE and the HSCIC are working to update this estimate and will provide updates in future publications. \n Additional information is available in an FAQ format.  \n The first Innovation Scorecard was published in January 2013, using data from 2011. The second publication in September 2013 reported data for 2012. The Innovation Scorecard has since been published on a quarterly basis, showing data for additional quarters since October 2013. It has also developed over this time to include new treatments recommended by NICE and by enhancements to the format and presentation.  \n Please note that data for 10 medicines (Bendamustine, Bortezomib, Cetuximab, Infliximab, Ipilimumab, Oxaliplatin, Pemetrexed, Rituximab, Topotecan and Trastuzumab) have not been included in this publication due to concerns around the quality of some of the underlying data received by the HSCIC. The HSCIC are in discussion with the data supplier to resolve these issues and data for these medicines will be included in future publications. \n Note that due to the size of the spreadsheets, they may take a few moments to open.  \n NHS England has released additional maps.

Survey 2014","What About YOUth? 2014 (WAY 2014) is a newly-established survey designed to collect robust local authority (LA) level data on a range of health behaviours amongst 15 year-olds. Therefore, this is also the first report to be published from the survey, covering the smoking findings only in order to meet the PHOF release data requirements.  \n The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) was commissioned by the Department of Health to run the survey in direct response to the Children and Young People?s Health Outcomes Forum. This Forum identified gaps in the Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) and other key health behaviour measures relating to young people. HSCIC contracted Ipsos MORI to carry out the survey. \n The PHOF included a placeholder indicator on smoking prevalence at age 15 and the data from this survey will now become the source for this PHOF indicator. This report covers all the information required for the PHOF on smoking prevalence plus other information on attitudes to smoking, e-cigarette use and use of other tobacco products (such as shisha) and will allow comparisons between LAs and against the national position.  \n The smoking prevalence findings needed for the PHOF have also been published by Public Health England (PHE) on 4 August 2015 via their Fingertips tool on their website (see resource links). \n WAY 2014 is the first survey to be conducted of its kind and it is hoped that the survey will be repeated in order to form a time series of comparable data on a range of indicators for 15 year-olds across England. Other than smoking, data has been collected on other topics including general health, diet, use of free time, physical activity, drinking, emotional wellbeing, drugs and bullying. HSCIC plan to publish a main report covering all the key findings from the survey in December 2015.

"1789","Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) ? Monthly Summary Statistics - Quarter 1 2015/16 (April to June)","\n Since 2009, care homes and hospitals have had to seek authorisation from their Local Authority if they need to deprive an individual who lacks capacity of their liberty as part of their care and/or treatment. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) currently collects data from Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs or councils) on Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) at case level on an annual basis. This information is then published in the annual report ?Mental Capacity Act, 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?.  \n Supreme Court judgments handed down on 19 March 2014 have led to a substantial increase in the volume of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) applications received by councils. As a result, a temporary, voluntary, data collection has been introduced to cover  the period 1 April 2014 ? 30 September 2015.  This quarterly collection enables stakeholders to monitor the scale of the Supreme Court judgments? impact on councils in a timely manner, and allows for any increase in the number of DoLS applications to be quantified and evidenced. \n In order to minimise the respondent burden on councils, only three data items are collected from each council: the number of DoLS applications made, and of these, the number of requests granted and not granted.  \n Councils have been encouraged to revise the data submitted for earlier quarters during the submission period for quarter 5, to take account of any changes in historic data since the original submissions for each quarter (further details can be found in Annex B). \n This release presents statistics from quarter 5 of the collection, covering 1 April to 30 June 2015, and also includes updated figures for all previous months, from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015.  The data show the position on 14 July 2015, when the returns were submitted and may be updated by councils in the final collection, as further applications are completed. \n Details of previous quarters? reports can be found in the Coherence and Comparability section of the Data Quality Statement at the rear of this report.","April 01, 2015 to June 30, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=18380","August 04, 2015","18380","Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

"1814","Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Statistics Monthly Report: Final May and Provisional June","\n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (May 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking.

"1827","Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England, 2014-15","\n Please note that this report was updated on 24 September 2015 to make a correction to the wording of footnote 8 (page 9). This had previously stated that those carers in receipt of self-directed support services are likely to have been assessed as having higher support needs than those in receipt of other support services; it should have stated that those carers in receipt of support services are likely to have been assessed as having higher support needs than those who do not receive support services. \n The resource &#39;CSV guidance and data dictionary&#39; has also been updated to provide clarification that where a record for a respondent has blank values for a given question, this is because no valid response was provided for that question. \n Note that no data or results in either the report or the CSV file have changed. \n Users of the report should ensure that they are using the current version, 1.1. The HSCIC apologises for this error and any associated inconvenience. \n The Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England is a biennial survey that took place for the second time in 2014-15. The survey covers informal, unpaid carers aged 18 or over, caring for a person aged 18 or over, where the carer has been assessed or reviewed, either separately or jointly with the cared-for person, by social services during the 12 months prior to the sample being identified. Carers were sent questionnaires, issued by Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs), in the period October to November 2014, to seek their opinions on a number of topics that are considered to be indicative of a balanced life alongside their caring role. Further information about the survey, including the methodology, can be found in the ?Methodology and Further Information? document in the Resources section of this page. National-level information is provided in this report. Annex files containing further national-level data, and data for all CASSRs in England, and the data used to produce this report (as a CSV file) are available in the Resources section below. \n A weighting methodology has been introduced for the 2014-15 survey. Although the impact of this change is small, in order to be able to make direct comparisons over time, the results from the 2012-13 survey have been recalculated using this new methodology, and any comparisons made to 2012-13 data in this report refer to these re-calculated figures. Consequently, 2012-13 figures presented in this report may not be an exact match to those in the original, experimental statistics release for 2012-13. The full set of recalculated results for 2012-13 are available in an annex table. The time series annex presents 2012-13 results calculated using the new weighting methodology. Further details about the new weighting methodology and other changes to the survey as compared to 2012-13 are available in the methodological change notice for this report, which is available via the Related Links section of this page. \n Findings from the survey are used to populate a number of measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF); these outcome scores will be published as part of the full suite of ASCOF outcomes on 6 October. \n CASSRs reported that 286,910 carers were assessed or reviewed in the 12 months prior to the 2014-15 survey. 57,380 out of a sample of 131,105 carers responded to the survey, which is a response rate of 44 per cent (down two percentage points from 2012-13).

Final data for 2014-15 are due to be published in November 2015; after submitting the provisional data underlying this report CASSRs have an opportunity to update their data in response to validation queries from the Health and Social Care Information Centre which assess the integrity of the data. \n The data for this adult social care expenditure report has been sourced from a new collection; the Adult Social Care Finance Return (ASC-FR) has replaced the previous finance (PSS-EX1) and reflects important aspects of the principles underpinning the transformation of social care. \n This is one of several collections which have changed as a result of proposals from the Zero Based Review (ZBR) and which draws on the new Equalities and Classifications Framework (EQ-CL). \n This is the first year of the new ASC-FR collection and all 152 councils made a submission; although the impact of the change in data source and the introduction of the new Equalities and Classification framework has meant some councils have experienced difficulties in completing their return for the initial pre validation deadline. As a result, some of these data presented are not representative of all 152 councils, details regarding this can be found in both the main text of this report and in the footnotes. \n The HSCIC works with councils in order to attain complete data submissions from all 152 councils for the final publication, however in this provisional publication caution should be exercised when evaluating the findings from these first cut data. In the first year of the return we expect to see greater changes between these provisional data and the final data. In addition, it should be noted that we have not provided any estimates for the provisional data and therefore, when discussing figures for 2014-15 and the 152 councils, figures may be understated and lower to the previous year which did include estimates. For further information on the data quality of these provisional data please see Appendix B. \n Gross current expenditure has been quoted within this summary unless otherwise stated. National level information is provided by primary support reason and service area in this summary. \n Primary support reason: Physical Support, Sensory Support, Support with Memory and cognition, Learning Disability Support and Mental Health Support. \n A five-year and ten-year comparison is made in relation to gross current expenditure. However, changes in the financial reporting framework mean it is not be possible to make direct comparisons between 2014-15 and previous years for the primary support reasons and service provision, with the exception of those items included in the bridging year. Further information is provided in the introduction of this report. Please note: on 08 October 2015, the csv file ?pss-exp-eng-14-15-prov-coun-lev-act-data? was updated with the following changes: the data within rows 52 to 85 for short term and additional activity have been corrected to align with the councils detailed in row 1.

"1834","Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Statistics Monthly Report: Final June and Provisional July","\n \n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (June 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160; We will be working with stakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements relating to specific services or groups of patients. \n Four new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation of the data. At local level these contextual figures will provide an indication of the increased caseload that could be attributed to the extension of the dataset to cover LD services. Information on these measures can found in the Announcement of Change paper which accompanies this release. \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking.

"1836","NICE Technology Appraisals in the NHS in England, Innovation Scorecard - to March 2015, Experimental statistics ","The objective of the Innovation Scorecard is to support appropriate access to NICE approved products (medicines, devices and diagnostics), by giving Health and Care commissioners and professionals information they can use to identify and act on unwarranted variation in patient access to these treatments. The Scorecard does this by transparently providing access to data, which can be used alongside a range of other data sources (including patient population outcomes) to measure progress in access to NICE approved products within local areas or at a national level. It is not intended to be used for performance management. \n The Innovation Health and Wealth Strategy set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. \n There is no central collection of data which can directly support the assessment of uptake of NICE recommendations, nor is data on the number of patients treated available. Therefore this is an experimental publication, which makes use of data currently available from a range of sources, both from the NHS and the commercial sector. The HSCIC welcomes comments and suggestions from users to support future development of appropriate datasets and reporting. \n The first Innovation Scorecard was published in January 2013, using data from 2011. The second publication in September 2013 reported data for 2012. The Innovation Scorecard has since been published on a quarterly basis, showing data for additional quarters since October 2013. It has also developed over this time to include new treatments recommended by NICE and by enhancements to the format and presentation. \n The inclusion criteria for medicines have been updated in this publication. Medicines with a TA published from 2011 onwards, which is positively appraised by NICE have been included. All other inclusion criteria remain unchanged. Medicines with a TA between January 2008 and December 2010 are available in earlier publications of the innovation scorecard. \n In this publication the medicines and medical technologies are presented in separate interactive spreadsheets. These spreadsheets use macros to allow users to identify the organisations, interventions and time periods they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables, charts and maps to identify trends and variation. A ?How to?? tab on the interactive spreadsheets explains how to use them. \n An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive spreadsheets should be viewed in conjunction with the report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted. \n In addition, an estimates report looks at the use of a range of appraised medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. \n Additional information is available in an FAQ format. \n Due to the experimental status of the publication and the provisional nature of some of the data from operational processes, some figures may be revised from publication to publication as issues are uncovered and resolved. The experimental status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. Users should always use the figures in the latest publication to ensure they are the most up to date figures available. \n Please note, figures for Debrisoft monofilament debridement pad (MTG17) per 100,000 population have been revised in the October 2015 publication. Previously published figures are incorrect. Due to concerns over the quality of some of the underlying data received by the HSCIC, the data for Alemtuzumab and Rituximab has been suppressed for Quarter 4 2014/15. The HSCIC are in discussion with the data supplier to resolve these issues and data will be included in future publications. \n Note that due to the size of the spreadsheets, they may take a few moments to open. \n NHS England has released additional maps.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems.  \n Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months, reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms.  \n These statistics relate to the contracted positions within English NHS organisations and may include those where the person assigned to the position is temporarily absent, for example on maternity leave. \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) are a legal framework that exist to ensure that individuals who lack the mental capacity to consent to the arrangements for their care, where such care may (because of restrictions imposed on an individual?s freedom of choice or movement) amount to a ?deprivation of liberty?, have the arrangements independently assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of the individual concerned .A key element of the safeguards is that health and care providers must formally apply to their local Council with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSR, council or local authority) and satisfy six different assessment criteria. \n The Supreme Court?s judgment of March 2014 in the case of ?Cheshire West? clarified an ?acid test? for what constitutes a deprivation of liberty. The acid test states that an individual who lacks the capacity to consent to the arrangements for their care and &#160; is subject to continuous supervision and control and is not free to leave their care setting, is deprived of their liberty and should be the subject of a DoLS application (where they are in a care home or hospital setting). The Supreme Court also ruled that the individual?s objection to the arrangements that amount to a deprivation of liberty is not a relevant consideration (even if the individual is not objecting, a DoLS application is required).The judgment marked a significant change to established practice. \n The data used to generate this report are collated by the HSCIC from a mandatory data collection of all councils, for all DoLS applications that were received, processed or considered to be ?active? in any way between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015. \n The data tables published alongside the report present further analyses and breakdowns of the data, including breakdowns by council and care provider (i.e. a care home, nursing home, hospital etc.).

"1851","Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey, England - 2014-15","The Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS) is an annual survey for England that took place for the fifth time in 2014-15. The survey covers all service users aged 18 and over in receipt, at the point that data are extracted, of long-term support services funded or managed by the social services following a full assessment of need. It seeks to learn more about how effectively services are helping service users to live safely and independently in their own homes, and the impact that these services have on their quality of life. Service users were sent questionnaires, issued by Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs), in the period January to March 2015. Further information about the survey, including the methodology, can be found in the ?Methodology and Further Information? document in the Resources section of this page. \n &#160; \n The numbers in the report are rounded to the nearest five.  \n &#160; \n The percentages in the report are rounded to the nearest whole number thus the figures given for each question may not add up to 100 per cent. National-level information is provided in this report. Further national-level data, data for all CASSRs in England and final, national-level data for the ASCS for 2010-11 to 2014-15 are provided as annex files.  \n &#160; \n The data used to produce the report are available in a CSV file. These are available in the Resources section below. \n There have been a number of changes to the survey methodology for 2014-15 which are detailed in full in the methodological change notice that was published by the HSCIC in July 2015, which is available via the Related Links section of this page. The text of the methodological change notice is reproduced in Appendix C of the report. The most important changes to note are: \n &#160; \n ? The population covered by the survey now includes only those in receipt of long-term support services; those in receipt of low-level support only (e.g. equipment and adaptations, professional support, short-term residential care) are not included in the survey population or sample. \n ? The population covered by the survey now includes those service users who receive support from CASSRs in terms of assessment and care management but who pay in full for the cost of their services (full cost clients); previously service users were included only where the CASSR made a contribution towards the costs of services received. \n ? The methodology used to weight the results has been enhanced to improve the accuracy of the estimates presented. \n &#160; \n Because of these changes, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between data for 2014-15 and previous years.  \n &#160; \n Therefore, comparisons are not included in this report. The effects of the above changes, in reference to 2013-14 and 2014-15 data, are described in Appendix B of the report. \n Findings from the survey are used to populate a number of measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework; these outcome scores have been published and can be found in the &#39;Measures from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, England - 2014-15&#39; report, a link to which is provided in the Related Links section.  \n &#160; \n CASSRs reported that at the point that data for the survey were extracted from local systems, there were 673,860 service users aged 18 and over in receipt of long-term support services funded or managed by the social services following a full assessment of need. 69,510 out of a sample of 192,995 service users responded to the survey, which is a response rate of 36 per cent (whereas it was 38 per cent in 2013-14). \n &#160; \n UPDATE: The comma-separated values (CSV) data file was enhanced in December 2015 to include fields showing all of&#160;the categories in Support Setting and Mechanism of Delivery. These fields (&#39;SupportSetting&#39; and &#39;MechanismDelivery&#39;) are described in the CSV guidance and data dictionary workbook. \n &#160; \n Please note: (15/02/16).&#160; The ?CSV guidance and data dictionary? annex for this publication has been replaced in order to correct the labelling of the ?Variable Descriptions? columns for gender, ethnicity and age in the ?DataDictionary? worksheet.

The measures are grouped into four domains which are typically reviewed in terms of movement over time.&#160; A number of these measures however have seen changes to their source data or definition which have resulted in year-on-year comparisons not being appropriate.&#160; Time-based comparisons are therefore not always provided and further explanation can be found in Chapter 3 (Comparability).&#160; In summary however, the new Short and Long Term Support (SALT) data collection has replaced the previous activity (RAP and ASC-CAR) collections.&#160; This impacts on the following measures: 1C, 1E, 1G, 2A, 2B and 2D.&#160; Furthermore, the introduction of SALT has also affected the eligible population used in determining the Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS) samples.&#160; The following measures are therefore also impacted 1A, 1B, 1I(1), 3A, 3D(1), 4A and 4B. \n As mentioned above, some of the measures included use survey data (the Adult Social Care Survey and the Survey of Adult Carers in England) and are therefore based on a sample of possible respondents.&#160; It is not possible to know the true value for the overall population in these cases however the variation present in the sampled data can be used to assess whether a change or difference is statistically significant.&#160; Where this is the case, statistical significance will be stated in the report.&#160; The non-survey-based measures use transactional data drawn from operational systems and so use all available data points.&#160; Any changes or differences presented, on the assumption of robust data quality, can therefore be taken as conclusive.","April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=18979","October 06, 2015","18979","Official statistics","Social care"

In addition, the breakdown for STS002b.c was corrected from ?Support Setting? to ?Carer Support? and the breakdown for STS002b.d, previously unstated, was updated to ?Support Setting?. These headings have also been updated on the individual table pages.

Start Excel as normal 2. Click on the PowerPivot tab&#160;  3. Click on the PowerPivot Window icon (top left) 4. In the PowerPivot Window, click on the ?From Other Sources? icon 5. In the Table Import Wizard e.g. scroll to the bottom and select Text File 6. Browse to the file you want to open and choose the file extension you require e.g. CSV \n Once the data has been imported you can view it in a spreadsheet. \n What does the data cover? &#160; General practice prescribing data is a list of all medicines, dressings and appliances that are prescribed and dispensed each month. A record will only be produced when this has occurred and there is no record for a zero total. &#160; For each practice in England, the following information is presented at presentation level for each medicine, dressing and appliance, (by presentation name): \n - the total number of items prescribed and dispensed  - the total net ingredient cost  - the total actual cost  - the total quantity \n The data covers NHS prescriptions written in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. The data includes prescriptions written by GPs and other non-medical prescribers (such as nurses and pharmacists) who are attached to GP practices. &#160; GP practices are identified only by their national code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the practice code - provides further detail in relation to the practice. \n Presentations are identified only by their BNF code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the BNF code - provides the chemical name for that presentation.","August 01, 2015 to August 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=19114","November 20, 2015","19114","Open data","Primary care services"
"1866","Inpatients Formally Detained in Hospitals Under the Mental Health Act 1983 and Patients Subject to Supervised Community Treatment, England - 2014-2015, Annual figures","This publication summarises information collected about uses of The Mental Health Act (1983) (?The Act?), as amended by The Mental Health Act 2007 (?The 2007 Act?) and by other legislation, during 2014/15. Under The Act, people with a mental disorder may formally be detained in hospital in the interests of their own health or safety, or can be treated in the community but subject to recall to hospital when necessary for assessment and/or treatment under a Community Treatment Order (sometimes referred to as ?Supervised Community Treatment? or ?SCT?).  \n &#160; \n The figures presented in this publication are the official statistics on uses of The Act in health services and will be of interest to clinicians, service managers and those with a responsibility for monitoring, administrating or application of The Act. It will also be of interest to academics and third sector organisations and especially to people who have experience of The Act either as a user of mental health services themselves or as a friend, carer or relative. \n &#160; \n Data were collected via the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) online Omnibus KP90 collection from organisations in England that are registered to provide Mental Health Services and make use of the Mental Health Act 1983 legislation, as amended. These include high security psychiatric hospitals as well as other NHS service providers and independent hospitals. \n &#160; \n All figures in this publication are at England level and are produced from the KP90 collection unless otherwise stated. We have made some changes to the presentation of this information to provide a consistent approach in terms of time series and types of provider across the key measures. The release is accompanied by reference data tables and a machine readable file including key measures at provider level. \n &#160; \n The publication also makes reference to relevant figures from other data sources, including equalities information from the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) and Data on the Use of section 136 Mental Health Act 1983 collected and published by the National Police Chiefs? Council (NPCC). The Mental Health Bulletin 2014-15 is published on the same day this report. Whilst this report remains the official source of figures for the year, the Mental Health Bulletin publication presents several complementary measures, broken by age, gender, ethnic group and CCG ? detail that is not available from the collection that this report is based upon.","April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=19118","October 23, 2015","19118","Official statistics","Mental health"
"1867","Mental Health Bulletin, Annual Report - 2014-15","This annual Mental Health Bulletin provides a comprehensive picture of people who used adult secondary mental health and learning disability services. This report is based on submissions made using version 4.1&#160; of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) between April and August 2014 and version 1.1&#160; of the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) between September 2014 and March 2015. The changes between the MHMDS and the MHLDDS reflect the expansion in scope of the dataset to include people in contact with NHS funded or part funded learning disabilities services for the first time. This report also uses the most recent age/gender and ethnicity population data from the Office for National Statistics. \n &#160; \n From these monthly submissions we produced a single file (the annual file) which removes duplication of episodic and record data that occurs between and within these monthly submissions. This follows the same approach we used in 2011/12 and 2012/13 when submissions were made every quarter. \n &#160; \n Analysis of monthly submissions and associated data quality measures has already been released as monthly publications (around 10 weeks after the end of the month reported on). Our publication of March 2015 data (published in June 2015) included initial analysis of annual data, allowing users of our annual data access much earlier than usual. These monthly publications can be accessed through the link at the bottom of this page. \n &#160; \n For consistency, much of the information produced in this report and reference tables are updates to those produced in last year?s publication, allowing the reader to compare this year?s data to previous years. This is the second year we have been able to provide analysis at Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level, which has allowed us to produce time series information at this level for the first time. \n &#160; \n Other time series have been maintained at a high level within our reference tables, but in many places analysis has been limited to 2011/12 as the earliest time period. This is because significant changes were made to the MHMDS in this year (moving from version 3.5 to version 4.0) which means that information before this is not directly comparable. Additionally, the expansion in scope of the dataset to include people in contact with learning disability services means that local knowledge may be required to interpret changes in the information presented between 2013/14 and 2014/15. \n &#160; \n Demographic analysis (age, gender and ethnicity) is presented for 2014/15 at national level and at subnational level where numbers allow. The reader is advised to consult previous publications (as appropriate) for historical data. \n &#160; \n The 2014-15 Mental Health Bulletin is published on the same day as the Inpatients Formally Detained in Hospitals Under the Mental Health Act 1983 and Patients Subject to Supervised Community Treatment, England - 2014-2015 report. Whilst the Inpatients formally detained? report remains the official source of figures for the year, this publication presents several complementary measures, broken by age, gender, ethnic group and CCG ? detail that is not available from the collection that Inpatients formally detained? is based upon.","April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=19123","October 23, 2015","19123","Official statistics","Mental health"

"1888","Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Statistics Monthly Report: Final August and Provisional September","\n \n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (August 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160;  \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking. This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page. \n This release also includes a note about the new experimental data file and&#160;the issuing of the ISN for the Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS). \n During summer 2015 we undertook a consultation on Adult Mental Health Statistics, seeking users views on the existing reports and what might usefully be added to our reports when the new version of the dataset (MHSDS) is implemented in 2016.&#160; A report on this consultation can be found below. \n Please note: &#160; The Monthly MHLDS Report published in February will cover November final data and December provisional data and will be the last publication from MHLDDS.&#160; Data for January 2016 will be published under the new name of Monthly Mental Health Statistics, with a first release of provisional data planned for March 2016.","August 01, 2015 to September 30, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=19315","November 24, 2015","19315","Official statistics","Mental health"

"1908","Personal Social Services: Expenditure and Unit Costs, England - 2014-15, Final release","This summary provides information about the money spent on adult social care by the social services departments of Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs) in England. This report contains final data from 152 CASSRs and relates to the period 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015; this report supersedes the provisional publication which was based on an earlier cut of the data and it should be noted that the figures within this report do differ from those reported in the provisional publication. These data are used by central government for public accountability, policy monitoring and national accounts, and by local authorities to assess their performance in relation to their peers.  The data for this adult social care expenditure report has been sourced from a new collection; the Adult Social Care Finance Return (ASC-FR) has replaced the previous finance return (PSS-EX1) and reflects important aspects of the principles underpinning the transformation of social care. This is one of several collections which have changed as a result of proposals from the Zero Based Review (ZBR) and which draws on the new Equalities and Classifications Framework (EQ-CL).  \n This is the first year of the new ASC-FR collection and all 152 councils made a submission; although the impact of the change in data source and the introduction of the new Equalities and Classification framework have meant that many councils have experienced difficulties in completing parts of their returns. Challenges reported by councils have included: accurately&#160; aligning expenditure and activity to the new primary support reasons and apportioning expenditure and activity to the new sections of the return.&#160; Further information (including council details) on these and other data quality items can be found in Appendix B of this report and&#160; caution should be exercised when evaluating the findings from this report.&#160;  \n Gross current expenditure&#160; has been quoted within this summary unless otherwise stated. National level information is provided by primary support reason, service area, care type and support setting in this summary.  \n Primary Support Reason has replaced Primary Client Groups from the previous PSS-EX1 return and will allow the service to better define the reasons why people need help or support.  \n A Client Group records the health condition that may result in the client having support needs, but does not describe the type of support required by the client. For example: \n ? An older person may have mild learning difficulties, but due to increasing frailty their primary support need may be for personal care support. ? Someone with a long term physical disability may develop mental health needs. \n A Client Group puts those individuals into one, inflexible box for counting and monitoring purposes, and someone (usually the social worker) has to make decisions as to which one. The new approach is that the Primary Support Reason is determined through assessment. As a client?s support needs may change over time, the Primary Support Reason should be re-examined and, if required, updated as part of the client review process. The five PSRs within the return are: \n ? Physical Support ? Sensory Support ? Support with Memory and cognition ? Learning Disability Support ? Mental Health Support \n A five year and ten year comparison is made in relation to gross current expenditure. However, changes in the financial reporting framework mean it is not possible to make direct comparisons between 2014-15 and previous years for the primary support reasons and service provision, with the exception of those items included in the bridging year data. Further information is provided in the introduction of this report. \n Note: A new comparator file was added to this report on 05/07/2016. \n &#160;","April 01, 2014 to March 31, 2015","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=19459","November 26, 2015","19459","","Social care"

This Forum identified gaps in the Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) and other key health behaviour measures relating to young people. HSCIC contracted Ipsos MORI to carry out the survey. \n WAY 2014 is the first survey to be conducted of its kind and it is hoped that the survey will be repeated in order to form a time series of comparable data on a range of indicators for 15 year-olds across England. Data has been collected on general health, diet, use of free time, physical activity, smoking, drinking, emotional wellbeing, drugs and bullying.

"1918","NICE Technology Appraisals in the NHS in England, Innovation Scorecard - to June 2015, Experimental statistics","The objective of the Innovation Scorecard is to support appropriate access to NICE approved products (medicines, devices and diagnostics), by giving health and care commissioners and professionals information they can use to identify and act on unwarranted variation in patient access to these treatments. \n The Scorecard does this by transparently providing access to data, which can be used alongside a range of other data sources (including patient population outcomes) to measure progress in access to NICE approved products within local areas or at a national level. It is not intended to be used for performance management. \n The Innovation Health and Wealth Strategy set out plans to support development and adoption of innovation in the NHS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal process assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing medicines and treatments, and provides guidance on their use by the NHS. \n There is no central collection of data which can directly support the assessment of uptake of NICE recommendations, nor is data on the number of patients treated available.  \n Therefore this is an experimental publication, which makes use of data currently available from a range of sources, both from the NHS and the commercial sector.  \n New for January 2016: \n - Introduction of groups of medicines that are options for treatment of certain conditions. These four groups are: Alzheimer?s disease; Novel Oral Anti-coagulant (NOAC) use split by primary and secondary care conditions; and Osteoporosis. The 13 medicines involved in the groups have been removed from the individual medicine spreadsheet and are presented in a new spreadsheet. \n - Actual Daily Doses (ADD), a new prescribing measure, has been developed where current prescribing measures are not appropriate or representative of prescribing in England. \n &#160;- 13 NHS England Regions were established from 1 April 2015 to replace the previous 27 Area Teams. In this publication, data for the latest quarter 2015/16 Q1 is available by NHS England Region. The previous 7 quarters of data have been mapped from Area Teams to the new NHS England Regions to provide a consistent time series. \n &#160;- Two new estimates have been developed for this publication: medicines to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and medicines to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. These new estimates include ranges as recommended by the Government Statistical Service (GSS) Methodological Committee. \n The HSCIC requests comments from users on the changes introduced to this publication. Please send feedback to enquiries@hscic.gov.uk or call 0300 303 5678 \n Further Information: \n In this publication the individual medicines, grouped medicines and medical technologies are presented in separate interactive spreadsheets. These spreadsheets use macros to allow users to identify the organisations, interventions and time periods they wish to explore. The data is also presented in tables, charts and maps to identify trends and variation.  \n An accompanying report describes the data, the sources and its limitations. Please note that the interactive spreadsheets should be viewed in conjunction with the report, and the caveats to interpretation should be noted. \n In addition, an estimates report looks at the use of a range of appraised medicines in relation to the number of eligible patients as estimated by NICE. Additional information is available in an FAQ format. \n Due to the experimental status of the publication and the provisional nature of some of the data from operational processes, some figures may be revised from publication to publication as issues are uncovered and resolved. The experimental status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. Users should always use the figures in the latest publication to ensure they are the most up to date figures available. \n Note that due to the size of the spreadsheets, they may take a few moments to open. NHS England has released additional maps. See the link provided below. \n Please note as of 23rd March 2016 the groupings spreadsheet and corresponding csv file have been removed due to data quality issues in the file. Users are advised not to use these files. A corrected version will be published on 12th April 2016 as part of the April Innovation Scorecard publication.

"1939","Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Statistics Monthly Report: Final September and Provisional October  ","\n \n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (September 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014.&#160; Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.&#160;  \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking. This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page. \n This release also includes a note about the new experimental data file and&#160;the issuing of the ISN for the Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS). \n During summer 2015 we undertook a consultation on Adult Mental Health Statistics, seeking users views on the existing reports and what might usefully be added to our reports when the new version of the dataset (MHSDS) is implemented in 2016.&#160; A report on this consultation can be found below. \n Please note: &#160; The Monthly MHLDS Report published in February will cover November final data and December provisional data and will be the last publication from MHLDDS.&#160; Data for January 2016 will be published under the new name of Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics, with a first release of provisional data planned for March 2016.

The data collected includes mother&#39;s demographics, booking appointments, admissions and re-admissions, screening tests, labour and delivery along with baby&#39;s demographics, diagnoses and screening tests. &#160; The MSDS has been developed to help achieve better outcomes of care for mothers, babies and children. As a &#39;secondary uses&#39; data set, it re-uses clinical and operational data for purposes other than direct patient care, such as commissioning, clinical audit, research, service planning and performance management at both local and national level. It will provide comparative, mother and child-centric data that will be used to improve clinical quality and service efficiency, and to commission services in a way that improves health and reduces inequalities.  &#160; These statistics are classified as experimental and should be used with caution. Experimental statistics are new official statistics undergoing evaluation.

No refreshes of the provisional data will take place either as part of the regular publication process, or where minor enhancements to the methodology have an insignificant impact on the figures at a national level. \n However, the provisional status allows for this to occur if it is determined that a refresh of data is required subsequent to initial release. Where a refresh of data occurs, it will be clearly documented in the publications. \n The monthly publication is an accurate summary of the validated data extracted from the NHS&#39;s HR and Payroll system. It has a provisional status as the data may change slightly over time where trusts make updates to their live operational systems.  \n Given the size of the NHS workforce and the changing composition, particularly during this period of transition, it is likely that we will see some additional fluctuations in the workforce numbers over the next few months, reflecting both national and local changes as a result of the NHS reforms.  \n These statistics relate to the contracted positions within English NHS organisations and may include those where the person assigned to the position is temporarily absent, for example on maternity leave. \n We welcome feedback on the methodology and tables within this publication.

There is no refresh MHLDDS submission for December as this would coincide with the first submission MHSDS for January 2016 data and there will not be a release of December 2015 Final data. A monthly data file and an executive summary based on provisional December 2015 are included in this release to give the latest possible information from MHLDDS. Users of the provisional monthly data file for December should note that two measures in this file could not be produced from provisional data and these missing items have been replaced with $ symbol. A Methodological Change paper with more detail about the changes to this publication can be found below. \n This statistical release makes available the most recent Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS) final monthly data (November 2015). This publication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users of NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in England. \n The scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover Learning Disability services from September 2014. Many people who have a learning disability use mental health services and people in learning disability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity included in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental health or learning disability spells of care ? a single spell of care may include inputs from either of both types of service.  \n The Currencies and Payment file that forms part of this release is specifically limited to services in scope for currencies and payment in mental health services and remains unchanged. \n This information will be of particular interest to organisations involved in delivering secondary mental health and learning disability care to adults and older people, as it presents timely information to support discussions between providers and commissioners of services. The MHLDS Monthly Report also includes reporting by local authority for the first time. \n For patients, researchers, agencies, and the wider public it aims to provide up to date information about the numbers of people using services, spending time in hospital and subject to the Mental Health Act (MHA). Some of these measures are currently experimental analysis. \n The Currency and Payment (CaP) measures can be found in a separate machine-readable data file and may also be accessed via an on-line interactive visualisation tool that supports benchmarking. This can be accessed through the related links at the bottom of the page. \n This release also includes a note about the new experimental data file and the issuing of the ISN for the Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS). \n During summer 2015 we undertook a consultation on Adult Mental Health Statistics, seeking users views on the existing reports and what might usefully be added to our reports when the new version of the dataset (MHSDS) is implemented in 2016.

Did diabetes management minimise the risk of avoidable complications?  \n ? Did harm result from the inpatient stay?  \n ? Was patient experience of the inpatient stay favourable?  \n ? Has the quality of care and patient feedback changed?  \n The Annual Report provides a summary of the 2015 audit findings for England and Wales, and where possible compares to the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 audit findings. There was no audit collection or report in 2014, so 2014 data is not available. The audit is supported by the Hospital Level Analysis, which provides results at individual site level. \n This publication&#160;was produced in two parts: the comparative hospital-level analysis was published on 08 March 2016 and the National Report&#160;was published on 23 June 2016. On 23 June 2016, the presentation outlining the key findings from the NaDIA 2015 audit that was presented by the NaDIA clinical lead, Gerry Rayman, at the Diabetes UK Professional Conference 2016, was also added to this release.

The July 2016 data will be published on Friday 7 October 2016, however these dates are constantly under review and may move earlier. \n What does the data cover? General practice prescribing data is a list of all medicines, dressings and appliances that are prescribed and dispensed each month. A record will only be produced when this has occurred and there is no record for a zero total. &#160; For each practice in England, the following information is presented at presentation level for each medicine, dressing and appliance, (by presentation name): \n - the total number of items prescribed and dispensed  - the total net ingredient cost  - the total actual cost  - the total quantity \n The data covers NHS prescriptions written in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. The data includes prescriptions written by GPs and other non-medical prescribers (such as nurses and pharmacists) who are attached to GP practices. &#160; GP practices are identified only by their national code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the practice code - provides further detail in relation to the practice. \n Presentations are identified only by their BNF code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the BNF code - provides the chemical name for that presentation.  \n Warning: Large file size (over 1GB).  Each monthly data set is large (over 4 million rows), but can be viewed in standard software such as Microsoft WordPad (save by right-clicking on the file name and selecting &#39;Save Target As&#39;, or equivalent on Mac OSX).

A type 1 opt-out prevents information being shared outside a GP practice for purposes other than direct care.  \n A type 2 opt-out prevents information being shared outside of&#160;NHS Digital&#160;for purposes beyond the individual&#39;s direct care. A more detailed description of opt-outs is available (see related links). \n Type 1 and type 2 opts-outs are presented at GP practice level.

The August 2016 data will be published on Friday 4 November 2016, however these dates are constantly under review and may move earlier. \n What does the data cover? General practice prescribing data is a list of all medicines, dressings and appliances that are prescribed and dispensed each month. A record will only be produced when this has occurred and there is no record for a zero total. &#160; For each practice in England, the following information is presented at presentation level for each medicine, dressing and appliance, (by presentation name): \n - the total number of items prescribed and dispensed  - the total net ingredient cost  - the total actual cost  - the total quantity \n The data covers NHS prescriptions written in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. The data includes prescriptions written by GPs and other non-medical prescribers (such as nurses and pharmacists) who are attached to GP practices. &#160; GP practices are identified only by their national code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the practice code - provides further detail in relation to the practice. \n Presentations are identified only by their BNF code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the BNF code - provides the chemical name for that presentation.  \n Warning: Large file size (over 1GB).  Each monthly data set is large (over 4 million rows), but can be viewed in standard software such as Microsoft WordPad (save by right-clicking on the file name and selecting &#39;Save Target As&#39;, or equivalent on Mac OSX).

"2172","Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014","The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) series provides data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorder in the English adult population (aged 16 and over). This survey is the fourth in a series and was conducted by NatCen Social Research, in collaboration with the University of Leicester, for NHS Digital.  \n The previous surveys were conducted in 1993 (16-64 year olds) and 2000 (16-74 year olds) by the Office for National Statistics, which covered England, Scotland and Wales. The 2007 Survey included people aged over 16 and covered England only. \n The survey used a robust stratified, multi-stage probability sample of households and assesses psychiatric disorder to actual diagnostic criteria for several disorders.  \n The report features chapters on: common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and self-harm, and comorbidity. \n All the APMS surveys have used largely consistent methods. They have been designed so that the survey samples can be combined. This is particularly useful for examination of low prevalence population groups and disorders. For example, in the APMS 2014 survey report, analyses of psychotic disorder (Chapter 5) and autism (Chapter 6) have been run using the 2007 and 2014 samples combined. Due to the larger sample size, we consider estimates based on the combined sample to be the more robust.&#160; Further notes on the Autism chapter can be found with that chapter and in the ?Additional notes on autism? document below. \n NHS Digital are planning a consultation exercise to obtain feedback from users on the APMS publication and statistics. The consultation will inform the design, content and reporting of any future survey and will be available in the consultations section of our public health webpage by 1 November 2016 (see Related Links).","January 01, 1993 to December 31, 2014","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=21938","September 29, 2016","21938","Survey|0/Official statistics","Illnesses and conditions"

"2178","Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (England), Annual Report 2015-16","This official statistics report provides the findings from the Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) data collection for the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016. &#160;  It includes any application that was active during the reporting year. The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) are a legal framework that exist to ensure that individuals who lack the mental capacity to consent to the arrangements for their care, where such care may (because of restrictions imposed on an individual?s freedom of choice or movement) amount to a ?deprivation of liberty?, have the arrangements independently assessed to ensure they are in the best interests of the individual concerned .A key element of the safeguards is that health and care providers must formally apply to their local Council with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSR, council or local authority) and satisfy six different assessment criteria. \n &#160; \n The Supreme Court?s judgment of March 2014 in the case of ?Cheshire West? clarified an ?acid test? for what constitutes a deprivation of liberty. The acid test states that an individual who lacks the capacity to consent to the arrangements for their care and &#160;  is subject to continuous supervision and control and is not free to leave their care setting, is deprived of their liberty and should be the subject of a DoLS application (where they are in a care home or hospital setting). The Supreme Court also ruled that the individual?s objection to the arrangements that amount to a deprivation of liberty is not a relevant consideration (even if the individual is not objecting, a DoLS application is required).The judgment marked a significant change to established practice. \n &#160; \n The data used to generate this report are collated by the NHS Digital from a mandatory data collection of all councils, for all DoLS applications that were received, processed or considered to be ?active? in any way between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016. \n &#160; \n The data tables published alongside the report present further analyses and breakdowns of the data, including breakdowns by council and care provider (i.e. a care home, nursing home, hospital etc.). \n &#160; \n Please note (07/10/16):  The main publication document has been replaced to correct five figures and to make some specific changes to improve the accuracy of the wording. &#160;  These are as follows: \n &#160; \n Corrections to figures \n &#160; \n ? Page 13: The narrative content associated with Figure 1.5 has been amended to state that the South East (rather than London) received the lowest proportion of applications accompanied by an urgent authorisation (34 per cent of 32,310 applications, or 11,090 urgent applications). &#160;  This text originally stated that this was London, with the following figures referenced in the text: 36 per cent, 21,420 applications and 7,680 urgent applications. &#160;  The figures included within the table were correctly stated. \n ? Page 25: The narrative content associated with Figure 3.1 (the number of DoLS authorisations that occurred during 2015-16) incorrectly included a figure of 67,555. &#160;  The correct figure was 54,765 and this has now been included in the text. &#160;  This figure was also used to determine the ratio between granted and authorised applications. &#160;  This was originally stated as 88% and this has now been corrected to 72%. &#160;  The figure included within the chart was correctly stated as 54,765. \n &#160; \n Amendments to wording \n &#160; \n ?

"2182","Maternity Services Monthly Statistics, England ? May 2016, Experimental statistics","\n \n This is a report on NHS-funded maternity services in England for May 2016, using data submitted to the Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS). \n &#160; \n The MSDS is a patient-level data set that captures key information at each stage of the maternity service care pathway in NHS-funded maternity services, such as those maternity services provided by GP practices and hospitals. The data collected includes mother&#39;s demographics, booking appointments, admissions and re-admissions, screening tests, labour and delivery along with baby&#39;s demographics, diagnoses and screening tests. \n &#160; \n The MSDS has been developed to help achieve better outcomes of care for mothers, babies and children. As a &#39;secondary uses&#39; data set, it re-uses clinical and operational data for purposes other than direct patient care, such as commissioning, clinical audit, research, service planning and performance management at both local and national level. It will provide comparative, mother and child-centric data that will be used to improve clinical quality and service efficiency, and to commission services in a way that improves health and reduces inequalities.  \n &#160; \n These statistics are classified as experimental and should be used with caution. Experimental statistics are new official statistics undergoing evaluation. They are published in order to involve users and stakeholders in their development and as a means to build in quality at an early stage. More information about experimental statistics can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.","May 01, 2016 to May 31, 2016","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=22093","October 06, 2016","22093","","Public health"
"2183","Safeguarding Adults, Annual Report, England 2015-16, Experimental Statistics","This report provides the key findings from the Safeguarding Adults Collection (SAC) data collection for the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016.&#160; This report presents information about adults at risk for whom safeguarding concerns or enquiries were opened during the reporting period, and case details for safeguarding enquiries which concluded during the reporting period. A safeguarding concern is where a council is notified about a risk of abuse, which instigates an investigation (enquiry) under the local safeguarding procedures. This is the first reporting year since safeguarding adults became a statutory duty for councils on 1 April 2015. Some of the terminology and definitions used in this report, therefore, have changed from previous publications to meet current practices. Care should be taken when making comparisons to previous years due to these changes. The SAC data collection only includes cases of suspected abuse where a council safeguarding service has been notified and has entered details onto their system. It does not include cases where partner agencies have dealt with the allegation and not shared the information with the council. It is likely that there are cases of abuse that have not been reported to councils.","April 01, 2015 to March 31, 2016","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=22101","October 05, 2016","22101","","Social care"
"2184","HES-DID Data Linkage Report - Provisional Summary Statistics, April - May 2016 (Experimental Statistics)","\n Following the NHS Digital &#39;Consultation on Statistics 2016-17 to 2018-19&#39;, we are stopping production of this monthly HES-DID Linkage publication series. This is the last release but linkage data will continue to be made available to extract customers. In addition, key figures about each month?s linkage, which are currently made available in this publication, will instead be made available on the NHS Digital website each month. \n This is the latest statistical publication of linked HES (Hospital Episode Statistics) and DID (Diagnostic Imaging Dataset) data held by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The HES-DID linkage provides the ability to undertake national (within England) analysis along acute patient pathways to understand typical imaging requirements for given procedures, and/or the outcomes after particular imaging has been undertaken, thereby enabling a much deeper understanding of outcomes of imaging and to allow assessment of variation in practice.  \n This publication aims to highlight to users the availability of this updated linkage and provide users of the data with some standard information to assess their analysis approach against.  \n The two data sets have been linked using specific patient identifiers collected in HES and DID. The linkage allows the data sets to be linked from April 2012 when the DID data was first collected; however this report focuses on patients who were present in either data set for the period April to May 2016. For DID this is provisional 2016/17 data. For HES this is provisional 2016/17data. \n The linkage used for this publication was created on&#160;07 September&#160;2016 and released together with this publication on 06&#160;October&#160;2016. \n \n","April 01, 2016 to May 31, 2016","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=22109","October 06, 2016","22109","Official statistics","Hospital care"

It contains aggregate information mainly taken from council administrative systems used to record the process of assessing eligibility to state funded social care and providing services where people are eligible. &#160;  This is the second year of the SALT (Short and Long Term) collection and councils were provided with the opportunity to revise their 2014-15 data; as such, some data has been updated from last year. The report explains that only some of the councils who would have liked to review the data had the technology and resources to do so. Given this, caution should be taken in reviewing year on year trends.","April 01, 2015 to March 31, 2016","http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=22118","October 05, 2016","22118","Official statistics","Social care"
