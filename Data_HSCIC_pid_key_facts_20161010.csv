However, the mean cotinine level among current cigarette smokers was significantly lower after 1 July, indicating a reduction in cigarette consumption after the legislation was introduced.

Gross income in 2004/05 was reported as ?236,330 and the Expenses to Earnings ratio as 55.0 per cent. </li><li>The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is now aware there are a number of reasons for this 30.5 per cent increase, including an estimated 7.6 percentage points which are attributable to the inclusion of employer's superannuation contributions in GPs' pay for the first time in 2004/05. This is equivalent to ?6,234. </li><li>Until 2003-04, employer's contributions to the NHS Pension Scheme (14 per cent of superannuable income ) were not included in tax returns and were therefore excluded from estimates of average GP net income based on tax return data. From 2004/05 onwards, employer's contributions should have been included in tax returns. The methodology presented allows an estimate of the element of employer's contributions included in 2004/05 net income to be made, and can also be applied in future years. </li><li>Recorded employer's contributions are estimated to account for ?6,234 per GP in 2004-05. Subtracting this amount from the previously published headline results of the 2004/05 EEQ gives the following estimates for UK GPMS GPs on a comparable basis to earlier years: - Average net income: ?100,170 (an increase of 22.8 per cent since 2003-04) - Average gross income: ?230,097 (an increase of 14.1 per cent since 2003-04) - Expenses to earnings ratio: 56.5 per cent (compared to 59.5 per cent in 2003-04). </li></ul><h4>Paper D ??? detailed results</h4><ul><li>In 2004/05, average net income was ?103,564 in England, ?91,151 in Northern Ireland, ?82,696 in Scotland and ?91,588 in Wales. </li><li>Between 2003/04 and 2004/05, average net income increased by 22.1 per cent in England, 34.9 per cent in Northern Ireland, 24.9 per cent in Scotland and 23.8 per cent in Wales. </li><li>Average net income increased with GP age up to the 50-59 age group, and then decreased slightly in the 60 and over age group </li><li>Urban practices had a lower average net income than rural practices </li><li>Among GPs in England, those in the South West had the lowest average net income (?89,341) </li><li>Average net income decreased as the number of partners in the practice increased </li></ul><h4>Paper E distributional results</h4><ul><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 3,060 GPs (9.0 per cent) had a net income of up to ?50,000. In 2003/04, this figure was 5,138 (15.8 per cent). </li><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 15,442 GPs (45.6 per cent) had a net income of between ?50,000 and ?100,000. In 2003/04, this figure was 19,883 (61.0 per cent). </li><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 12,264 GPs (36.2 per cent) had a net income of between ?100,000 and ?150,000. In 2003/04, this figure was 6,469 (19.8 per cent). </li><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 2,492 (7.4 per cent) of GPs had a net income of between ?150,000 and ?200,000. In 2003/04, this figure was 904 (2.8 per cent). </li><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 629 GPs (1.9 per cent) had a net income of at least ?200,000. In 2003/04, this figure was 222 (0.7 per cent). </li><li>In 2004/05, it is estimated that 475 GPs (1.4 per cent) had a net income of between ?200,000 and ?250,000. It is estimated that 154 GPs (0.5 per cent) had a net income of at least ?250,000. </li><li>Dispensing GPs are distributed towards the higher ends of the gross earnings, expenses and net income distributions, compared to non-dispensing GPs. It is estimated that 3.9 per cent of dispensers (209 GPs) and 1.5 per cent of non-dispensers (420 GPs) received a net income of at least ?200,000.</li></ul><h4>Paper F waves 4a and 5a PMS results</h4><ul><li>In the year prior to transferring to the PMS scheme, PMS GPs had an increase in average net income similar to that of their GMS cohorts. </li><li>In the year that they joined the PMS scheme, there was a step change in the rise of average net income of PMS GPs which was greater than that seen among their GMS cohorts. </li><li>This is the last in the series of PMS earnings studies and a summary of all the results are included. </li></ul><h4>Paper G quality and outcomes framework score analysis</h4><ul><li>Both gross earnings and expenses slightly increase with increasing QOF score, and consequently the expenses-to-earnings ratios remain relatively unaffected. </li></ul><h4>Paper H salaried GP results</h4><ul><li>In 2004/05, average net income among UK GPMS GPs identified as being salaried (more schedule E than schedule D income) was ?45,560. </li><li>It is important to note that the results presented do not differentiate between full- and part-time GPs, and that these results only refer to a sample of salaried GPs who submitted a self-assessment tax return to HMRC in 2004/05. </li></ul>"

"162","1","<h4>Detentions in hospital </h4><ul><li>Total detentions, including detentions subsequent to admission and detentions after removal to a place of safety, rose by 1,692 (3.5 per cent) to 49,417, which was the largest increase in three years. </li><li>There were 30,774 formal admissions to hospital, which represent an increase of 7.3 per cent from 2008/09. Formal admissions for assessment (under section 2 of the Act) contributed most to this increase. </li><li>Whereas last year the increase in formal admissions was due to an increase in formal admissions to independent sector hospitals, this year's increase was solely due to an increase in formal admissions to NHS facilities. </li><li>Although the number of formal admissions to independent sector hospitals fell, the percentage of such admissions via the criminal justice system has been rising for the last four years and in the latest figures they were 28 per cent of all formal admissions to independent sector hospitals. There is also evidence that more than 1,000 patients detained in independent sector hospitals at 31 March 2010 had been there for longer than one year.</li></ul><h4>Place of Safety Orders </h4><ul><li>The number of Place of Safety Orders (where the place of safety was a hospital) rose to 12,300, an increase of 40.4 per cent since 2008/09 and over double the number reported in 2005/06 (when there were 5,877). There was a comparable increase in the number of Place of Safety Orders that resulted in an informal status, so that the person was not further detained.</li></ul><h4>Community Treatment Orders </h4><ul><li>This year was the first time in which a full year's data was collected about CTOs. There have been 6,237 orders made since the introduction of supervised community treatment (SCT) in November 2008 and the data show that just 1,965 (31.5 per cent) of these orders had ended (either via a revocation or a discharge) by 31 March 2010. This suggests some people are being kept on SCT for long periods of time.</li></ul>"
"166","1","<p><strong>Uses of the Mental Health Act 1983</strong></p><ul><li>Although the total number of formal admissions to hospital and the number of new Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) decreased between 2010/11 and 2009/10, the overall number of people subject to the Mental Health Act at 31st March increased by 5.0 per cent, from 19,947 in 2009/10 to 20,938 in 2010/11. This increase can be attributed to a rise of 29.1 per cent (4,291) in people on a CTO at 31st March as well as an increase of 16,647 (0.2 per cent) in people detained in hospital. These figures include CTOs and formal admissions for both NHS and independent sector services. </li></ul><p><strong>Possible link between formal detention and CTO figures </strong></p><ul><li>Admissions for treatment under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act fell by 14.4 per cent. This may be connected to the use of CTOs in two ways. A rise in the number of recalls to hospital for patients on CTO (from 1,217 in 2009/10 to 1,601 in 2010/11), approximately 64 per cent of which resulted in a revocation of the CTO, suggests that some ?repeat formal admissions' now appear as revocations of CTOs, rather than as formal admissions. The underlying Section on which a patient was originally detained remains in place whilst they are on a CTO. In addition, the use of CTOs may enable patients to stay sufficiently well so they can be managed successfully in the community. </li></ul><p><strong>Place of safety orders </strong></p><ul><li>The number of uses of place of safety orders (Sections 135 and 136) increased between 2009/10 and 2010/11 by 17.1 per cent. The proportional rise was greater for females than for males (19.1 per cent compared with 15.5 per cent). </li></ul><p><strong>Announcement of consultation </strong></p><ul><li>A consultation on changes to these statistics, made possible by a change in data source recommended as part of the Secretary of State's Fundamental Review of Returns, is planned for launch early 2012.

"388","1","<h4>Prevalence of caring (see chapter 2) </h4><ul><li>Overall, 12 per cent of people aged 16 or over in England in 2009/10 were looking after or giving special help to a sick, disabled or elderly person. This represents around 5 million adults in England. Six per cent of adults in England were caring for someone who was living with them, and 6 per cent were caring for someone living elsewhere only. </li><li>15 per cent of households in England contained a carer. This represents around 3 million households in England. </li></ul><h4>Profile of carers (see chapter 3) </h4><ul><li>Carers were more likely to be women than men; 60 per cent of carers in England were women. </li><li>Carers were most likely to be aged 45-64 (42 per cent); a quarter (25 per cent) were aged 65 or over. </li><li>Around half (46 per cent) of carers were in paid employment, 27 per cent were retired from paid work and 13 per cent were looking after their home or family </li><li>92 per cent of carers were white, while 8 per cent were from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds. </li><li>Around two in five carers (37 per cent) were the only support for their main cared for person, while the remainder reported shared caring responsibilities. This means that around 1.7 million adults in England were the sole carer for their main cared for person. </li><li>48 per cent provided care for 20 or more hours per week. Carers with such heavy commitments had a different profile to those who were caring for fewer hours per week; they were more likely to be aged 65 or over (30 per cent compared with 20 per cent) and less likely to be in full-time employment (17 per cent compared with 35 per cent). </li><li>Overall, 62 per cent of carers felt their own general health was good, while fewer than one in ten (8 per cent) felt their health was bad. In comparison with the Health Survey for England (2008) carers were considerably less likely to describe their general health as good (62 per cent compared to 76 per cent), though this reflects, in part, the older age profile of carers. </li><li>83 per cent of carers were looking after one person only, 14 per cent were looking after two people and 3 per cent looked after three or more people. </li><li>27 per cent of carers had been looking after their (main) cared for person for at least ten years, including 8 per cent who had been providing support for 20 years or more. </li><li>Carers performed a wide variety of tasks for the person they mainly cared for - they were most likely to provide practical help (such as preparing meals, shopping and doing the laundry) (82 per cent), keep an eye on the person they cared for (76 per cent), keep them company (68 per cent) or take them out (62 per cent). </li><li>11 per cent of all carers reported receiving Carer's Allowance and 27 per cent received Disability Living Allowance/Attendance Allowance. This rose to 23 per cent of carers who cared for 35 hours or more per week receiving Carer's Allowance and 50 per cent receiving Disability Living Allowance/Attendance Allowance. </li></ul><h4>The impact of caring upon carers (see chapter 4) </h4><ul><li>Overall, 80 per cent of carers defined their quality of life as ?good'. Those who were providing more than 20 hours of support per week or were looking after someone in the same household were less likely to say this was the case (72 per cent and 75 per cent respectively). </li><li>Around half (52 per cent) of carers said their health had been affected because of the care they provide. A wide range of effects were mentioned; a third of carers reported feeling tired (34 per cent), 29 per cent felt stressed, 25 per cent had disturbed sleep and 22 per cent reported being short tempered or irritable. </li><li>Around two in five carers (42 per cent) said their personal relationships, social life or leisure time had been affected because of the assistance they provided. Those who had been affected in this way were asked an unprompted question to establish the effects of caring. The most common effects were having less time for leisure activities (69 per cent), being too tired to go out (32 per cent), being unable to go on holiday (23 per cent) and the effect upon their own health (20 per cent). </li><li>When asked about spending time doing social or leisure activities specifically, 25 per cent of carers said they had less time with friends and 20 per cent had less time for pastimes or hobbies because of their caring responsibilities. </li><li>Six in ten carers (61 per cent) anticipated that the amount of time they spend caring will increase in the next five years, while just 8 per cent felt it would decrease. </li><li>Amongst carers who were of working age, 26 per cent felt their caring responsibilities had affected their ability to take up or stay in employment, although nearly three quarters (74 per cent) did not feel this was the case. Carers aged 35-54 were most likely to say that caring had affected them in this way (32 per cent). </li><li>Amongst carers who were of working age but not in employment, 27 per cent indicated that they were interested in taking up paid employment; 16 per cent were interested in doing so in the near future and 10 per cent would think about doing so when their caring responsibilities were reduced. </li><li>Flexibility in working hours was the most important thing that would help carers who wanted to work to take up paid employment (68 per cent); in addition 34 per cent said the ability to work from home would help them. </li><li>Awareness of the right to request flexible working from an employer was very low amongst all carers (19 per cent), but higher amongst carers who were in work (27 per cent of carers in full-time employment and 24 per cent of those in part-time employment). </li></ul><h4>Support and Services for Carers (see chapter 5) </h4><ul><li>Only a small number (6 per cent) of carers said they had been offered a carer's assessment and 4 per cent had actually been assessed. Two per cent said they had been offered a review of their own needs and 1 per cent said they had actually had such a review. </li><li>67 per cent of carers who had been assessed said they had received a service of some kind as a result of the assessment. The most common services were equipment such as mobility aids (26 per cent), services for the person they care for (22 per cent), an assessment of the person they care for (21 per cent) and information about benefits (20 per cent). </li><li>Almost two thirds (66 per cent) of carers reported that they would need someone else to care for their main cared for person if they wanted to take a break for a couple of days. For shorter breaks from caring of a couple of hours, 27 per cent of carers said that someone else would be needed if they wanted to take a break. </li><li>84 per cent of carers who said that someone else would be needed if they wanted to take a break for a couple of days did have someone they could rely on to look after the person they cared for. However, 16 per cent (or, 11 per cent of all carers) said there was no one they could rely on if they wanted to take a break. </li><li>Those carers who had someone else they could rely upon were most likely to say that another relative would be on hand to look after their main cared for person if they wanted to have a break for a couple of days (91 per cent). </li><li>58 per cent of carers who would need someone else to look after the person they cared for said they had had a break of 2 days or more, meaning that a large minority (42 per cent) had not taken such a break since they started looking after their main cared for person. </li><li>Two per cent of all carers reported that their main cared for person had made use of a sitting service in the last year. The same percentage said they had used a befriending service in the same period. Overall, 3 per cent reported using one or both of these services. </li></ul><h4>Profile of the people being cared for (see chapter 6) </h4><ul><li>Overall, 61 per cent of carers were looking after women, while 39 per cent were looking after men. Half (50 per cent) were looking after someone aged 75 or older, while 8 per cent were caring for someone under 16. </li><li>Carers were most likely to be looking after a close family member, such as a parent (33 per cent), a spouse or partner (26 per cent) or a child (13 per cent).

Injuries can result from not warming up properly, using inadequate equipment, pushing yourself too hard or having an accident. Injuries will typically include bruises, sprains, strains, minor head injuries or tendonitis although in rarer cases injuries can include major head injuries, broken bones or ligament damage. Injuries can be classed as 'sudden' or 'overuse'. Overuse injuries result from repetitive actions and are often experienced by professional sports players (e.g. Tennis Elbow, Shin Splints) although children whose bodies are still growing are also vulnerable. Many minor injuries will heal themselves or will be self-treated (e.g. Using? pain killers or ice on a sprain). However, in other cases the injury may result in an attendance at A&amp;E.<br>The Department of Health are the Official Source of A&amp;E statistics through Quarterly Monitoring of Accident and Emergency (QMAE).

The next largest group - measured by number of admissions - was assault by sharp object (4,490). For the majority of assault types the number of?admissions is less than one hundered.</li><li>North West Strategic Health Authority had the highest rate of admissions for assaults per 100,000 of all FAEs.</li><li>FAEs due to assault are far more common amongst males than females. Males represented 82.6 per cent of all such admissions.</li><li>Assault admissions by age follow a similar trend for both genders: there is a peak amongst young adults between the ages?of 18 and 25, the number of admissions then steadily decreases as age increases. Although the trends for both genders are?similar the much higher number of male admissions causes the peak for young adult males to be far more pronounced.</li><li>There were a total of 185,941 A&amp;E attendances as a result of assault, a 0.2 per cent decrease on the previous 12 months. Overall?A&amp;E Attendances increased 8.4 per cent over the same period.</li></ul>"

Of these 3.7 million (20.8 per cent) resulted in admission to hospital for inpatient treatment, 3.5 million (19.7 per cent) resulted in a GP follow up, and 6.8 million (38.7 per cent) were discharged with no follow up. </li></ul><p>Key facts for admissions due?to bites, strikes and stings from dogs, other mammals, non-venomous arthropods and other animals. </p><p><strong>Provisional data for the period May 2011 to April 2012 shows:</strong></p><ul><li>Bites, strikes and stings accounted for 12,423 finished admission episodes, almost unchanged from the previous 12 month period when there were 12,436 admissions. </li><li>Being bitten or stuck by a dog accounted for over half (6,447; 52 per cent) of these admissions. </li><li>There was a clear seasonal trend for bites and stings from non-venomous arthropods with highest admissions in summer and lowest admissions in winter. Although less pronounced, admissions for dog bites or strikes were also lowest during winter months. </li><li>Rates of admission for bites or stings from non-venomous arthropods were highest in the 40-44 age group. For other mammals rates were highest in the 65-69 age groups. For dog bites and strikes the highest rate was for very young children (5 to 9). </li><li>Rates of admission for dog bites or strikes showed the most regional variation, with the highest rates in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber regions and lowest in London and the South East Coast. London showed the lowest rate of bites or strikes by other mammals but one of the highest rates for stings or bites by non-venomous arthropods. </li></ul><p>Dog bites and strikes accounted for over half of admissions and show the most variation by age and region. Therefore further analysis is included for these admissions. </p><ul><li>Dog bites accounted for 6,447 admissions, representing an increase of 5.2 per cent from the 6,127 admissions in the previous 12 month period. </li><li>Further analysis shows that overall slightly more males (52.4 per cent) were admitted for dog bites or strikes than females. Rates of admission were highest for young children, especially those aged 5 to 9. Rates of admission for men were similar between the ages of 15 and 50 before decreasing in older ages whereas for women, admission rates were highest for those in their late forties to early fifties. </li><li>The largest variation in dog bites or strikes between regions was seen in the younger age groups with higher rates of admissions in northern SHAs. For all age groups admissions were lowest in London and the South East Coast regions. </li><li>Plastic surgery was the treatment speciality with the highest rate of admissions for all age groups under 70 and was highest for those aged 0 to 9. The 0 to 9 age group also had the highest admission rate for the Oral or Maxillo facial surgery treatment speciality and this is consistent with sustaining more facial injuries. Admission rates in the Trauma and Orthopaedics treatment speciality were highest in the older age groups (especially 50 to 69) and this is consistent with sustaining more injuries to the body.</li></ul>"

At one week, less than half of all mothers (46 per cent) were exclusively breastfeeding, while this had fallen to around a quarter (23 per cent) by six weeks.?

"1038","1","<p>Gross current expenditure<sup>1</sup> has been quoted within this summary unless otherwise stated. National-level information is provided by type of service and service user in this summary. Trends are generally shown over a five-year period where comparable and a ten-year comparison is made for total gross current expenditure. Data on grants and unit costs are not comparable over five years, so only changes from the previous year are shown.</p><p><strong>National expenditure</strong></p><ul><li>Gross current expenditure by CASSRs on adult social care in 2011-12 was ?17.2 billion, compared to ?17.0 billion in 2010-11. This is a one per cent rise in cash terms but a decrease of one per cent in real terms<sup>2</sup>. Over the five years between 2006-07 and 2011-12 real terms expenditure increased by three per cent. Over the ten-year period between 2001-02 and 2011-12 there was an increase in real terms expenditure of 33 per cent.</li><li>There has been a change in how service users funded as part of the Valuing People Now initiative<sup>3</sup> have been accounted for in 2011-12. Funding has transferred from the NHS to CASSRs so the money is no longer included as income from the NHS and netted off gross current expenditure. Further, additional monies have been given to CASSRs via the NHS for spending on social care services which will also benefit the NHS<sup>4</sup>. When expenditure in 2011-12 is adjusted to take account of these impacts, it is estimated that it has fallen since 2010-11 by between 2 per cent and 7 per cent in real terms<sup>5</sup>.</li></ul><p><strong>Expenditure by type of service user</strong></p><ul><li>Over half (52 per cent) of expenditure was on older people (those aged 65 and over) in 2011-12.? People aged 18-64 with a learning disability accounted for 30 per cent of expenditure, while those aged 18-64 with a physical disability accounted for nine per cent, and those aged 18-64 with mental health needs for seven per cent. Other adult services accounted for two per cent of expenditure and less than one per cent was spent on asylum seekers and service strategy. </li></ul><p><strong>Expenditure by type of service</strong></p><ul><li>The proportion of expenditure accounted for by residential care has decreased over the five-year period 2006-07 to 2011-12, from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. Over the same period the proportion of expenditure accounted for by day and domiciliary care has increased from 41 per cent to 45 per cent. The remaining 11 per cent of expenditure in 2011-12 was spent on assessment and care management.</li><li>Expenditure on Direct Payments for adults was ?1.1 billion in 2011-12 compared to ?360 million in 2006-07. This is an increase of around 210 per cent in cash terms and around 175 per cent in real terms. The percentage of expenditure accounted for by Direct Payments to adults has increased, equating to six per cent of gross current expenditure in 2011-12 compared to two per cent in 2006-07. </li></ul><p><strong>Grants</strong></p><ul><li>Grants for adults (excluding carers) amounted to ?300 million in 2011-12, a decrease of four per cent in cash terms and six per cent in real terms since 2010-11. Grants as a proportion of ?provision by others? remained unchanged at two per cent.</li></ul><p><strong>Unit costs</strong></p><ul><li>The average cost per week for each adult supported in residential care, nursing care or intensively in their own home was ?609 in 2011-12, a decrease of two per cent in cash terms from ?623 in 2010-11 and five per cent in real terms.</li></ul><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ol><li>Gross current expenditure has been quoted within this summary unless otherwise stated. This is the total expenditure minus capital charges and less all income except for client contributions.</li><li>GDP deflators are a measure of general inflation in the domestic economy which can be described as a measure of price changes over time. Previous year ?cash term? prices are inflated to the current reporting year prices and referred to as ?real terms?

"1166","1","<p>There has been a year-on-year increase in the number of applications completed for deprivation of liberty under (DoLS) since their introduction in 2009-10. There were 11,887 applications in 2012-13, a 4 per cent?increase on the 11,382 applications in 2011-12, and a 66 per cent?increase on the 7,157 applications in 2009-10.?Although application numbers continued to increase, the rate of increase was smaller than in previous years. This pattern of rising applications is contrary to predictions that applications would fall at a constant rate between 2009-10 and 2015-16. </p><p>Consistent quarter-on-quarter increases in the number of people subject to standard authorisations at the end of the quarter (from 536 on 30 June 2009 to 1,976 on 31 December 2011) appear to have stalled in the reporting year of 2012-13. This number dropped to 1,667 (a decrease of 16 per cent) on 31 March 2012, decreasing further to 1,575 (-6 per cent) on 30 June 2013. The number of people subject to standard authorisations changed relatively little in subsequent 2012-13 quarterly snapshots. </p><p>More than half (55 percent?or 6,546) of all applications for deprivation of liberty under DoLS completed in 2012-13 had an authorisation granted, in line with 2011-12 (56 per cent) and 2010-11 (55 per cent) but higher than 2009-10 (46 per cent).? Where authorisations were not granted in 2012-13, this was usually because the supervisory body considered that the ?best interests? assessment had not been met (80 per cent?of applications where authorisation was not granted).?? </p><p>The majority (71 per cent) of applications in 2012-13 were completed on behalf of people with mental health conditions, with dementia accounting for more than half (54 per cent) of all applications made. This is likely to be related to the age profile of people who are subject to application for deprivation of liberty under DoLS (in 2012-13, 27 per cent?of applications related to people who were aged 85 and over).</p><p>Over half (55.8 per cent) of all authorisations granted in 2012-13 were for a duration of 0 to 90 days; relatively few authorisations (7 per cent) were granted for 365 days or more. LAs granted a higher proportion of authorisations with duration of more than 180 days (27 per cent) than PCTs (4 per cent). This may reflect differences between the care needs of hospital patients and care home residents. </p><p>Across England as a whole, 28.3 applications per 100,000 people aged 18 and over were made in 2012-13. Application rates rose sharply with age, ranging from 9.6 per 100,000 people for 18-64 year-olds to 265.3 per 100,000 people for those aged 85 and over.

The HSCIC needs to work with its partners to understand the extent and impact of this issue and agree how to resolve it, e.g. by:<br>??Understanding the breadth and depth of data recorded for direct clinical care more fully and making better use of them for secondary purposes<br>??Understanding that data quality requirements are driven by the intended use of data and that the methods used to assess, report and manage data quality will necessarily vary by use and, consequently, by user group<br>??Extending the auditing of data quality beyond Payment by Results to other areas where poor data quality could impact most on direct clinical care</li><li>The HSCIC undertakes a range of data quality activities but needs to continue to work on improving the consistency of these activities and the level of capability across programme areas supported by clear data management processes and policies</li><li>The HSCIC gives data quality advice and guidance to organisations and will continue to do so. However, organisations who submit data to the HSCIC are ultimately responsible for the quality of that data and for continuously improving its fitness for operational and strategic use.</li></ul>"

The number of people subject to CTOs (5,365) as a proportion of all those subject to The Act at the end of the year<sup>2</sup> has increased since their introduction to 'level off' at around 23 per cent from March 2013 onwards.

In general, standardised rates of hospital episodes are lower than their corresponding crude rates in parts of Yorkshire, Cheshire, and the south coast. This indicates that the comparatively older age structure of these areas' populations is affecting the number of hospital admissions for this procedure. Conversely, London and the midlands - which have comparatively younger populations - have slightly higher standardised rates than crude rates. As groin hernia procedures are most common amongst older age groups, this indicates that these areas have fewer episodes largely because of the age of their populations. </li><li>For hip replacement episodes, there are several areas with lower standardised rates than the corresponding crude rates; particularly in parts of the north-west and the central south coast. This indicates that the comparatively older age structure of these areas' populations is affecting the number of hospital admissions for this procedure.

As knee replacement procedures are most common amongst older age groups, this indicates that these areas have fewer episodes largely because of the age of their populations.</li><li>For varicose vein episodes, there are relatively small differences between the crude and standardised rates of episodes for people undergoing varicose vein procedures. Broadly, the crude rates are similar to the directly standardised rates, which indicates that the age makeup of populations does not have a significant impact on the number of hospital episodes for varicose veins. The spread of varicose vein procedures across a wide range of age groups further supports this.</li></ul>"

Further details are provided in the corresponding HES Admitted Patient Care data quality notes (link below).? This has a negligible impact on the SHMI at national level.

King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (RJZ) and Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust (RJ2) are reported in the SHMI. However, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust (RPG) is a community trust and is therefore excluded from the SHMI.<br>?<br>As part of the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data cleaning processes, checks are carried out to ensure that all records have a trust code which is open and valid using reference data supplied by the Organisation Data Service (ODS). South London Healthcare NHS Trust (RYQ) is now listed as a closed trust by ODS. Therefore, all activity previously submitted by South London Healthcare NHS Trust (RYQ) for the financial year 2013-14 has not been included in the provisional 2013-14 HES data from the month 8 publication onwards. Further details are provided in the corresponding HES Admitted Patient Care data quality notes (link below). The HSCIC's HES data quality team and ODS are working to implement rules to map the activity for closed organisations to the responsible providers as part of the HES data cleaning processes prior to the publication of finalised HES data for 2013-14.<br><br>This has a negligible impact on the SHMI at national level. However, because the SHMI is published to be reflective of current organisational structures, the SHMI values for King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (RJZ) and Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust (RJ2) will be based on incomplete data and should therefore be interpreted with caution.</li><li>It has come to our attention that there may be several trusts who are unable to record still births with a discharge method of ?Baby was still born? on their patient administration system (PAS) and are instead coding these records with a discharge method of ?Died?. This means that such records will be included in the calculation of the SHMI where they should have been excluded. We are currently reviewing this issue with initial investigations suggesting that the impact on the overall SHMI value for affected trusts is small.</li><li>The HSCIC is aware that there may be an impact of the present SHMI methodology on the SHMI value for integrated acute and community trusts. This is because activity from both acute and community sites at integrated trusts is included in the calculation of the SHMI, while activity from trusts which only provide community services is excluded. The HSCIC is investigating ways in which community activity for integrated trusts can be identified in the underlying dataset and will continue to review this issue with the SHMI Technical Working Group.</li><li>The total number of trusts has decreased by four from the same period a year previously due to the acquisition of Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust (provider code RVL) by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RAL), the establishment of the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust (provider code R1K) following the closure of Ealing Hospital NHS Trust (provider code RC3) and North West London Hospitals NHS Trust (provider code RV8), the acquisition of Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RD7) by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RDU) and the closure of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RJD).</li></ol>"

There was an overall decrease of 10,600 council adult social services jobs between 2013 and 2014 (an eight per cent decrease from 140,700 jobs in 2013). </li><li>For around two-thirds of councils (101 out of 152) the number of adult social services jobs reduced between 2013 and 2014. Of these councils, 39 saw a small reduction (less than five per cent) and 62 saw a larger reduction (five per cent or more). Despite the overall number of adult social services jobs decreasing, 46 councils increased their number of adult social services jobs over the period (20 by less than five per cent and 26 by five per cent or more). Councils with a change in their number of jobs of five per cent or more between 2013 and 2014 were required to provide reasons for the change. Of the 101 councils that saw a decrease in their number of jobs, 25 saw a change of less than five per cent and did not provide a reason (14 councils with a reduction of less than five per cent provided reasons). Some councils provided more than one reason for the decrease and have therefore been counted more than once. Of the 76 councils that did provide reasons the top three most commonly cited reasons were; </li><ul><li>Restructures ? 54 councils gave this as a contributing factor for their associated reduction of 6,300 jobs?</li><li>Outsourcing ? 18 councils / 4,500 jobs</li><li>Redundancies ? 16 councils / 2,400 jobs </li></ul><li>The total number of council-based adult social services jobs decreased year-on-year between 2011 and 2014 at a fairly constant rate (by approximately 10,000 jobs per year).

These proportions were unchanged from 2011, 2012 and 2013.</li><li>The average age of workers in adult social services jobs in 2014 was 47 years old. This is unchanged since 2011. The average age differed slightly by job role group, with workers in managerial jobs and direct care jobs having a marginally older average age of 48 years and workers in professional roles being slightly younger on average (45 years old). Over a quarter of jobs (28 per cent) were filled by workers aged 55 or over. The relatively high percentage of workers being aged 55 or over also contributes to the reasons workers leave. Retirement was a common reason for leaving employment as recorded in the NMDS-SC. NMDS-SC reasons for leaving data collected on a voluntary basis showed for 2,200 out of the 8,500 leaver records (26 per cent), retirement was given as the reason for leaving. </li><li>The majority (86 per cent) of the 130,100 adult social services jobs in 2014 were carried out by White workers, 14 per cent were carried out by workers from Black and Minority Ethnic groups.

However, A&amp;E HES data are incomplete; over 1.63 million A&amp;E attendances were reported in the Department of Health Situation Report data collection for the month, and 60 organisations that report data to Situation Reports did not report data to A&amp;E HES; these organisations are mostly lower acuity services such as minor injury units and walk-in centres.</p><p>?

"1664","1","<div><b>England </b><ul><li>There was a marked increase in the proportion of adults that were obese from 13.2 per cent in 1993 to 26.0 per cent in 2013 for men, and from 16.4 per cent to 23.8 per cent for women. The proportions that were overweight including obese increased from 57.6 per cent to 67.1 per cent in men and from 48.6 per cent to 57.2 per cent in women. <p></p><li>In reception year (aged 4-5) in 2013-14, the proportion of obese children (9.5 per cent) was higher than in 2012-13 (9.3 per cent) but lower than in 2006-07 (9.9 per cent). In Year 6 (age 10-11) in 2013/14, the proportion of obese children (19.1 per cent) was higher than in 2012-13 (18.9 per cent) and also higher than in 2006-07 (17.5 per cent). <p></p><li>In 2013, fewer men than women consumed the recommended five or more portions of fruit and vegetables on the previous day (25 per cent and 28 per cent respectively). A similar proportion of boys and girls consumed five or more portions per day (16 per cent of boys, 17 per cent of girls). <p></p><li>In 2013-14, there were 9,325 Finished Admission Episodes (FAEs) in NHS hospitals with a primary diagnosis of obesity. This is 15 per cent less admissions than in 2012-13 (10,957), although this is over five times as high as ten years ago in 2003/04 (1,711).<sup>a</sup> <p></p><li>In 2013-14, there were 6,384 recorded Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) with a primary diagnosis of obesity and a main or secondary procedure of bariatric surgery. This is 20 per cent less episodes than in 2012/13 (8,024). Females continue to account for the majority of these; there were 4,823 such recorded FCEs for females and 1,560 for males. This is a similar ratio to 2012-13 (6,080 for females and 1,944 for males) and 2003-04 (378 for females and 96 for males).<sup>a</sup> <p></p><li>In 2013-14, there were 3,391 recorded FCEs with a primary diagnosis of obesity and a main or secondary procedure of bariatric surgery in the 45-64 age group. This accounts for 53 per cent of all bariatric surgery procedures.<sup>a</sup> <p></p><li>Drug items dispensed for treating obesity in 2013 (563,000) rose by 44 per cent from 2012 (392,000) but this may be due to a stock shortage of Orlistat in 2012. The figure for 2013 is a decrease of 61 per cent on 2009 (1,450,000) when the number of drug items dispensed for treating obesity reached a peak. </li></ul>__________________________________________________ <br><b>Footnotes</b> <br><sup>a</sup> The data on hospital activity presented in this report are for inpatients only and therefore does not reflect all hospital activity. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses. This should be considered when interpreting changes over time as recording and clinical practice may change and in particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings. One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded 183 inpatient admissions in 2013/14 with a primary diagnosis of obesity compared to 920 inpatient admissions in 2012-13 which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,632 or 15 per cent). They have also recorded a decrease of 739 inpatient bariatric surgical procedures this year mainly due to gastric band maintenance procedures which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,640 ? 20 per cent). This Trust has also recorded 594 procedures in outpatient settings in 2013/14 with a primary procedure code of gastric band maintenance compared to none in 2012/13. These procedures are not included in this report as they were performed in an outpatient setting. </div>"

However, these records are not reported in the SHMI publication as they cannot be assigned to any current provider.

However, as this change occurred after data processing for the April 2015 SHMI publication began, data for The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases NHS Foundation Trust has not been included in the SHMI for Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust for this publication. From the July 2015 SHMI publication onwards the SHMI for Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust will also include data submitted by The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases NHS Foundation Trust.<br><br><li>It has come to our attention that there may be several trusts who are unable to record still births with a discharge method of ?Baby was still born? on their patient administration system (PAS) and are instead coding these records with a discharge method of ?Died?. This means that such records will be included in the calculation of the SHMI where they should have been excluded. We are currently reviewing this issue with initial investigations suggesting that the impact on the overall SHMI value for affected trusts is small.<br><br><li>The SHMI methodology has been designed for non-specialist acute trusts and so trusts which solely provide community services are excluded from the SHMI. However, integrated acute and community trusts (which provide both acute and community services) are included in the SHMI and some patients will move from acute care to community treatment. In such cases, the SHMI would consider the time period from the patient?s admission into acute care until 30 days following discharge from the community service. If the patient had instead been treated first at a trust providing only acute services and then transferred to a community trust then the time period considered by the SHMI would be from admission to the acute trust until 30 days following discharge from the acute trust. This has led to concerns that trusts are not being compared on a like-for-like basis.<br><br>It is not possible to identify community activity in the HES dataset and so it is not possible to identify the number of trusts affected by this issue, or the potential impact on these trusts. The number of affected trusts may increase over time as more trusts move to an integrated model of service provision and the impact is likely to vary depending on the nature of the community services provided e.g. rehabilitation services compared to palliative care. Trusts which only provide outpatient community services will be unaffected. The HSCIC will continue to review this issue with the SHMI Technical Working Group as part of the longer term development of the indicator.<br><br><li>The total number of trusts has decreased by four from the same period a year previously due to the acquisition of Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust (provider code RVL) by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RAL), the establishment of the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust (provider code R1K) following the closure of Ealing Hospital NHS Trust (provider code RC3) and North West London Hospitals NHS Trust (provider code RV8), the acquisition of Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RD7) by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RDU) and the closure of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust (provider code RJD).</li></ol>"

Over the ten year period from 2004-05, when the figure was ?13.5 billion, expenditure increased least 26 per cent in cash terms and half of one per cent in real terms. <br><br>The new return in 2014-15 shows that ?13.6 billion of gross current expenditure was spent on long and short term support combined; of which 53 per cent (?7.2 billion) was spent on people aged 65 and over, compared to 47 per cent (?6.4 billion) on people aged 18 to 64. <br><br>Expenditure on long term support <br><br>The new return in 2014-15 shows that 37 per cent (?6.2 billion) of gross current expenditure was spent on long term support for people aged 18 to 64; of which ?4.4 billion was spent on learning disability support, ?1.2 billion on physical support, ?600 million on mental health support, with the remaining ?100 million split between sensory support and support with memory and cognition. <br><br>Of the ?6.2 billion spent on long term support for adults 18 to 64 year olds, expenditure on residential care amounted to ?2.2 billion, whilst expenditure for direct payments and supported living amounted to ?1 billion each. <br><br>For people aged 65 and over, expenditure on long term support accounted for 40 per cent (?6.8 billion) of gross current expenditure; of which ?4.4 billion was spent on physical support, ?1.2 billion on support with memory and cognition,?540 million on learning disability support, ?480 million on mental health support and ?130 million on sensory support. <br><br>Of the ?6.8 billion spent on long term support for adults aged 65 and over, expenditure on residential care amounted to ?3.0 billion, whilst expenditure on nursing care amounted to ?1.3 billion and home care amounted to ?1.4 billion. <br><br>Expenditure on short term support <br><br>In the new return for 2014-15, for the 145 councils who submitted this data, the proportion of expenditure on short term support for people aged 18 to 64 was one per cent (?150 million) of gross current expenditure; of which ?70 million was spent on learning disability support and ?50 million on physical support.<br><br>For the 147 councils who submitted data for people aged 65 and over, expenditure on short term support accounted for two per cent (?430 million) of gross current expenditure; of which ?350 million was spent on physical support. <br><br>Other Social Services Expenditure <br><br>In the new return for 2014-15, for the 151 councils who submitted these data, nine per cent (?1.6 billion) of gross current expenditure was spent on social care activities and a further six per cent (?1.1 billion) was spent on commissioning and service delivery. <br><br>Bridging Year data <br><br>In order to allow for some time series comparisons this year?s ASC-FR return contained a bridging year sheet.

A further 18 per cent (333,000 clients) had been discharged from hospital. </li><li>The most common sequel to requests for support was Universal Services/Signposted to Other Services (31 per cent, or 575,000 requests), followed by No Services Provided ? any reason (28 per cent, or 520,000 requests). A further 16 per cent (304,000 requests) were offered ongoing low level support, with ST-Max and Long Term Support accounting for 12 per cent (218,000 requests) and eight per cent (144,000 requests) respectively.</li><li>STS004 is the only measure now available for direct year on year comparison. The percentage of those discharged still at home 91 days later has reduced slightly from 83 per cent in 2013-14 to 82 per cent this year, driven primarily by a decrease for those clients aged 85 and over. However, when considering a longer term view, this was up from 81 per cent, five years ago (2009-10).</li><li>There were 254,000 completed instances (for both new and existing clients) of Short Term Support to Maximise Independence (ST-Max) with a determined sequel during 2014-15. In addition, 29,000 were still accessing the support at year end.</li><li>For those receiving a completed instance of this form of support, the most common Primary Support Reason was Physical Support: Personal Care Support (70 per cent, or 178,000 requests).</li><li>After receiving Short Term Support, 26 per cent (65,000 clients) went on to receive Long Term Support, of which 93 per cent (60,000 clients) received this support in the Community.</li><li>890,000 clients accessed Long Term Support during 2014-15; of these, 659,000 were accessing the service at year end. 485,000 clients at year end had been in receipt of this Long Term Support for more than 12 months.</li><li>The most common Primary Support Reason for Long Term Support (received by 51 per cent or 450,000 clients), was Physical Support ? Personal Care support. </li><ul><li>Learning Disability support then followed, received by 16 per cent of clients and Mental Health support for 12 per cent. </li><li>Physical Support: Access and Mobility Only, and Support with Memory and Cognition each accounted for nine per cent of clients with the remainder split across Sensory Support and Social Support. </li></ul><li>86,000 clients were accessing Long term Support (Nursing) in 2014-15 with 194,000 clients accessing Residential support. These two settings supported 32 per cent of all clients accessing Long Term Support last year. The remaining 609,000 clients (68 per cent) were supported in the Community, most (350,000 clients, or 39 per cent) through a CASSR managed personal budget.?</li><li>Clients aged 65 and over account for two-thirds (68 per cent) of all clients accessing Long Term Support. Within this age group, nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) accessing Long Term Support during 2014-15 required Physical Support - Personal Care Support. Among those clients aged 18 to 64, the most common Primary Support Reason was Learning Disability support, accounting for 43 per cent of the age group.</li><li>There were 334,000 instances of support being provided direct to carers, of which 6,000 (one per cent) requests for carer support related to carers aged under 18. For 24 per cent of all requests for carer support, no direct support was provided.</li><li>In this first SALT collection, it was mandatory to report on those clients with Autism and Asperger?s Syndrome who received Long Term Support at year end. As of 31st March 2015, there were 12,000 clients with Autism and 5,000 clients with Asperger?s Syndrome (combined, they account for three per cent of all clients receiving Long Term Support at year end). These clients are predominantly aged between 18 and 64; 96 per cent of the 12,000 clients with Autism and 97 per cent of the 5,000 clients with Asperger?s Syndrome were in this age band. </li></ul><div><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>[1] This relates to new requests for social care support received by the council from new clients where the sequel, or outcome, to that request was determined during the year.

However, this may have resulted in a larger number of expected deaths being estimated for this trust than would have been the case if the missing data had been included in the analysis and so results for this trust should therefore be interpreted with caution. <p></p><li>Further information on data quality can be found in Appendix B: Background Quality Report of the SHMI quarterly report, which can be downloaded from the 'Resources' section of this page.</li></ol></div>"
