The latter include timely identification of those at risk (e.g. those with osteoporosis, likelihood of having an accident) and management of risk e.g. medication, home safety, mobility aides, padded clothing etc. Observational studies of surgical outcomes associated with fractured proximal femur have suggested that where there is a significant delay from admission to surgery, there is an increased risk of morbidity, complications, and poor rehabilitation. Guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians have specified that operations for fractured proximal femur should normally occur within 24 hours of admission. However, it is acknowledged that delayed surgery may be more a reflection of patients with other medical conditions making them unfit for surgery than of inadequate management. Whatever the reason for delayed surgery, it is a proxy for poorer outcomes. The NHS may be helped to learn lessons from organisations with lower rates of hospitalisation and higher rates of timely surgery following fractured proximal femur.""","""Emergency hospital admissions and timely surgery: fractured proximal femur: indirectly standardised percent, all ages, annual trend, P""",NULL,"""P00045""","""TBC""","""Sep-13""","""Relevant surgery within the first two days following emergency admissions to hospital of persons with fractured proximal femur."""

457,"""Years of life lost due to mortality from epilepsy: crude rate, 1-74 years, 3-year average, MFP </SPAN>""</DIV>","""Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of premature mortality. Its primary purpose is to compare the relative importance of different causes of premature death within a particular population and it can therefore be used by health planners to define priorities for the prevention of such deaths.

Early diagnosis can have a major impact on breast cancer survival. National policy for the screening programme is that eligible women aged 50-70 are invited for screening every 3 years. Because the programme is a rolling one which invites women from GP practices (or geographical areas) in a three year cycle, not every woman will receive an invitation as soon as she is 50. However, every woman should receive her first invitation before her 53rd birthday. Women who are over the upper age limit for routine invitations for breast screening are encouraged to make their own appointments at three yearly intervals.

Early diagnosis can have a major impact on breast cancer survival. National policy for the screening programme is that eligible women aged 50-70 are invited for screening every 3 years.

A meta-analysis of controlled trials in patients post-myocardial infarction showed that a combination of individual and group smoking cessation advice and assistance reinforced by primary care teams gave the highest success rates.The findings of primary prevention trials indicate that cessation of cigarette smoking should be advocated in the secondary prevention of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. It is recommended that all patients with hypertension should have a smoking history taken. It is widely agreed that smoking cessation is the most powerful lifestyle measure to lower blood pressure or cardiovascular risk.The risk of vascular complications in patients with diabetes is substantially increased. Because these vascular risks could be compounded by smoking, regular reminders to patients about smoking are justified. Health professionals involved in caring for diabetic patients should advise them not to smoke.Smoking cessation is the single most effective (and cost-effective) intervention to reduce the risk of developing COPD and stop its progression. Every tobacco user should be offered at least brief tobacco dependence treatment at every visit to the health care provider.There is epidemiological evidence that smoking is associated with poor asthma control. The evidence for the value of smoking cessation advice is largely extrapolated from studies in relation to coronary heart disease. It is recommended that smoking cessation be encouraged as it is good for general health and may decrease asthma severity.""","""Smoking cessation advice for smokers with selected conditions: percent, 15+ years, annual, P""",NULL,"""P01019""","""N/A""","""Links checked Mar 2016""","""As of March 2016, please refer to the data tables published as part of the Quality Outcomes Framework.

Stroke has a devastating and lasting impact on the lives of people and their families. Individuals often live with the effects for the rest of their lives. A third of people who have a stroke are left with long-term disability. Each year more than 110,000 people in England will suffer from a stroke which costs the NHS over £2.8 billion and £7 billion to the economy overall. Outcomes in the UK compare poorly internationally, despite services being among the most expensive, with unnecessarily long lengths of stay and high levels of avoidable disability and mortality. The Department of Health recognised the importance of developing better stroke services by including specific milestones, targets and actions in the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People launched in March 2001. Following on from this, the Department of Health has developed a new strategy for stroke services in England. Among the aims are to improve public and professional awareness of the risk factors and symptoms of a stroke, and what action to take. Lack of awareness of stroke is a significant problem. People do not know what a stroke is, what the symptoms are, or that it is a treatable disease that warrants the same response as a heart attack.

This level of control was lost from the early 1990s onwards when TB re-emerged in this country as a public health problem. Cases began to rise mainly as a result of increased migration of people from areas of the world where TB is more prevalent than it is in England. Ageing of the established population and TB in people with HIV infection made small but important contributions. There is an increasing proportion of TB cases in ethnic minority groups. People from the Indian Subcontinent and Sub Saharan Africa have very high rates of TB. These rates are highest in the few years after they first come to England, but the risk of their developing TB remains higher than average throughout their lives, and extends to their children born in England. Other high risk groups include the homeless and those with HIV infection. The national vaccination programme changed in September 2005 from routine immunisation of schoolchildren without natural immunity to: • All infants (aged 0 to 12 months) living in areas where the incidence of TB is 40 per 100,000 or greater; • All infants (aged 0 to 12 months) with a parent or grandparent who was born in a country where the incidence of TB is 40 per 100,000 or greater.""","""LBOI Indicator 13.2 - Tuberculosis cases (rate per 100,000 population)""",NULL,"""P01044""","""TBC""","""Dec-13""","""The number of cases of TB infection in residents of a PCT divided by the PCT resident population, multiplied by 100,000 to produce a crude rate per 100,000 people in the population.

Severe mental illness severely restricts the capacity to fully participate in society and in particular the employment market. Unemployment rates are high amongst people with severe mental illness. In the UK, unemployment rates of 60-100% have been reported. These high rates not only reflect the disability caused by severe mental illness, but also reflect discrimination (unemployment rates are higher than in other disabled groups) and the low priority given to employment by psychiatric services. People with long-term psychiatric disabilities are even less likely to be in employment than those with long term physical disabilities. Despite high unemployment rates amongst the severely mentally ill, surveys have consistently shown that most want to work. These low rates of employment should be considered against the facts that at least 30-40% of people who are significantly disabled by enduring mental illness are capable of holding down a job. More than 900,000 adults in England claim sickness &amp; disability benefits for mental health conditions.

People with mental health problems, and particularly schizophrenia, are at increased risk of premature death due to physical heath problems. Someone with schizophrenia has an expected life expectancy that is 10 years less than someone without a mental health problem. Specifically, people with severe mental health problems, including schizophrenia, have higher risks of cardiovascular disease and deaths from infectious diseases, endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive and genitor-urinary system disorders. It has been reported that deaths from smoking-related diseases are twice as high among people with schizophrenia. The prevalence of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia is relatively rare, and affect around one in 200 adults each year. However, as with other mental health problems, the prevalence of such disorders are associated with increased social inequalities and hence health inequalities. For example, those with a psychotic disorder, including schizophrenia are more likely to be unemployed and receiving state benefits than those without a psychotic disorder. Further, people from a black and minority ethnic group are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, be detained and treated compulsory under the Mental Health Act (1983) and be over-prescribed psychotropic medication. Prevalence of psychotic disorders is also thought to be at least 15 times higher amongst prison populations. The Government’s target on mental health uses suicide figures as a proxy indicator to monitor improvement in mental health across the nation. However, this target is difficult to monitor at a local level due to the small number of suicides and undetermined deaths and the associated issues around disclosure and sharing of small numbers.

It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.

Petrol and diesel-engine motor vehicles emit a wide variety of pollutants, principally carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulates (PM10), which have an increasing impact on urban air quality. In addition, photochemical reactions resulting from the action of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and VOCs from vehicles leads to the formation of ozone, a secondary long-range pollutant, which impacts in rural areas often far from the original emission site. Acid rain is another long-range pollutant influenced by vehicle NOx emissions. In all except worst-case situations, industrial and domestic pollutant sources, together with their impact on air quality, tend to be steady-state or improving over time. However, traffic pollution problems are worsening world-wide. According to the National Air Quality Archive the health effects of the pollutants measured in this indicator are: o Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. Continued or frequent exposure to concentrations that are typically much higher than those normally found in the ambient air may cause increased incidence of acute respiratory illness in children; o Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of the condition of people with heart and lung diseases. In addition, they may carry surface-absorbed carcinogenic compounds into the lungs; o Ozone irritates the airways of the lungs, increasing the symptoms of those suffering from asthma and lung diseases. In addition, a government report in 1997 found a clear relationship between deprivation and NO2 and PM10 levels.

Although it does not measure quality of care, it does indicate areas where access to health care may be a problem. The population is weighted for need to allow direct comparison between areas and allow for differences in need between areas. This indicator enables us to track change in the number of primary care professionals according to need. This indicator is a national headline inequalities indicator. In March 2008 the National GP Access Programme was established in response to recommendations in the report Primary Care Access and Responsiveness, with the aim of supporting the NHS in driving continuous improvements in the accessibility and responsiveness of GP services. As set out in World class commissioning for GP services, improving access to GP services can also help improve the quality of care, by improving the patient experience and reducing health inequalities. International studies have shown that increasing access to primary care professionals is one of the most effective ways to improve the health of that population, for example by improving smoking cessation and screening rates, and by improving quality for specific vulnerable groups; providing a starting point for practices and PCTs to undertake far-reaching improvements to other aspects of care quality; making practices better places of work for staff; reducing inappropriate (and often more expensive) time spent in secondary care, for example the circa 50% of minor attendances in accident &amp; emergency that could be dealt with in primary care.

A quarter of all deaths are due to cancer, a third from organ failure, a third from frailty or dementia, and only one twelfth of patients have a sudden death. It should be possible therefore to predict the majority of deaths, however, this is difficult, with errors occurring, 30 per cent of the time. Two thirds of errors are based <BR><BR>on over optimism and one third on over pessimism. However the considerable benefits of identifying these patients include providing the best health and social care to both patients and families and avoiding crises, by prioritising them and anticipating need. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Identifying patients in need of palliative care, assessing their needs and preferences and proactively planning their care, are the key steps in the provision of high quality care at the end of life in general practice. Therefore this QOF indicator set is focused on the maintenance of a register, (identifying the patients) and on regular multidisciplinary meetings where the team can ensure that all aspects of a patient’s care have been assessed and future care can be co-ordinated and planned proactively. <BR><BR><BR><BR>A patient should be included on the register if any of the following apply: <BR><BR><BR><BR>1. their death in the next 12 months can be reasonably predicted (rather than trying to predict, clinicians often find it easier to ask themselves ‘the surprise question’ – ‘Would I be surprised if this patient were still alive in 12 months?’). <BR><BR>2. they have advanced or irreversible disease and clinical indicators of progressive deterioration and thereby a need for palliative care e.g. they have 1 core and 1 disease specific indicator in accordance with the GSF Prognostic Indicators <BR><BR>Guidance (see QOF section of GSF website. <BR><BR>www.goldstandardsframework.nhs.uk) <BR><BR>3. they are entitled to a DS 1500 form.

For these purposes, a patient is considered as terminally ill if they are suffering from a progressive disease and are not expected to live longer than six months.) <BR><BR><BR><BR>The register applies to all patients fulfilling the criteria regardless of age or diagnosis.
