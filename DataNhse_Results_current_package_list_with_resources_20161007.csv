Details of the procedure and\nauthorisation process can be found in the NHS England document '[Procedures\nfor Clinical Commissioning Group Constitution Change, Merger or\nDissolution](http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Procedures-\nfor-CCG-constitution-change-merger-or-dissolution-FINAL2.pdf)' which states;  \n  \n""Any application for variation which will change a CCGs boundary or its list\nof members, and therefore have a potential impact on its financial allocation,\nmust be made by the 1 June deadline so that the change can be reflected in the\nallocations for the following year.""  \n  \nOnce the approval has been gained the GP Practice migration/ CCG boundary\nchanges form will need to be completed. This gives HSCIC Organisation Data\nService(ODS), the authority to move the hierarchy within the data files\nsupporting the NHS and Social Care Services. Please note this form must be\nsubmitted by the 1st March to ensure that the changes are implemented to the\nnational systems by the 1st April . The link below is for the guidance\ndocument (which includes the form to be completed): [CCG Boundary Change\nProcess (PDF, 427.3kB)](http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/ods/datadownloads/g\nppractice/ccg_bound_change.pdf)\n\n### EDISPENSARY & EPHARMACYHQ:\n\nNew data is now being supplied by the NHS Prescription Services (NHS PS) which\nidentifies dispensaries (pharmacies) in England.\n\nThe ODS process this dispensary data to produce parent Headquarters codes for\nthe organisations that own the dispensaries. Each Pharmacy Headquarters can be\nlinked to many dispensaries.\n\n### EBRANCHS:\n\nData for GPs and GP Surgeries has traditionally been supplied by the NHS\nPrescription Service (NHS PS), however this data only includes main surgeries\n- the more peripheral branch surgeries that these practices often run are not\nincluded in the NHS PS data.\n\nDue to a requirement relating to the National Programme for IT and the N3\nnetwork, there was a need for Branch Surgeries to be identified and coded -\nthe Branch Surgery codes are issued by the ODS team.\n\nBranch Surgery codes are allocated using the existing NHS PS GP Practice code\nfor the parent Surgery, to which a further three numerical characters are\nadded to define each branch e.g. 001, 002 etc.\n\nThe data includes each Surgery's organisation code, plus its name, address and\nparent surgery code amongst other information. See the file description linked\nagainst the file below for more detail.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE - BRANCH SURGERY CODES ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NHS PS.

It also lists a\nnumber of high-level Welsh organisations. This data is for current\norganisations, plus data for organisations that have closed in the current or\nprevious financial year.\n\nPlease note: NHS England Region (Geography) Q code format change - reference\ndata amendment to use alphanumeric (character) range. Current numeric (number)\nrange is to be discontinued after August 2017.\n\n**How Maintained:**\n\nIT Clusters closed in 2007. PAN SHAs and SHAs closed in 2013.\n\nNHS?England Commissioning Regions and NHS?England Region (Geography) are not\nlegal entities; they are sub-divisions of the NHS England. Information on\nthese entities is supplied directly to ODS by the NHS England.\n\nGovernment Office Region information is provided by the Office for National\nStatistics.\n\n### ESPHA:\n\nThis file contains codes for Special Health Authorities in England (note that\nSpecial HAs tend to be national organisations rather than administering a\nparticular area of the country). This data is for current organisations, plus\ndata for organisations that have closed in the current or previous financial\nyear. Note also that ODS code sites for Special Health Authorities, these can\nbe found in the eother.csv file.\n\n**How maintained**\n\nSpecial Health Authorities are statutory organisations. As such any\nestablishment, dissolution or changes to their name are published in a\nStatutory Instrument which is released on to the Government website of the\nOffice for Public Sector Information. The ODS check this website daily and\nimplement any changes required.\n\nInformation on Special Health Authorities is relayed to ODS via the\norganisations in question. This is facilitated by an established ODS contact\nbased within the organisation. No changes to the records associated to that\norganisation can be carried out without the express permission of the contact\nfor that organisation.\n\n### ECSU:\n\nEcsu.csv contains parent CSUs and Data Management and Integration Centres\n(DMIC).\n\nDMICs will collate commissioning intelligence pertaining to a number of CCGs,\nand provide this to other elements of the health service infrastructure\nincluding other CSUs.? The structure of DMICs is varied; some are hosted by a\nsubset of the CSUs, others are stand-alone organisations. A subtype will be\napplied to DMICs to indicate them. The subtype indicator will be held in field\n14 of the CSU release file.\n\nThis data is for current organisations, plus data for organisations that have\nclosed in the current or previous financial year.\n\n**How Maintained**\n\nAs hosts of the CSUs until April 2016, the NHS?England provided ODS with the\ninitial set of reference data for CSUs. However, following the publication of\nthis initial set of CSU reference data ODS will rely on the individuals and\norganisations that are assigned the codes to advise them of any changes in the\ndetails to the CSU parents/sites.\n\n### ECSUSITE:\n\nEcsusite.csv contains just CSU sites. This data is for current organisations,\nplus data for organisations that have closed in the current or previous\nfinancial year.\n\n**How Maintained**\n\nAs hosts of the CSUs until April 2016, the NHS?England provided ODS with the\ninitial set of reference data for CSUs.

The ODS team check this website daily and implement\nany changes required.\n\n### ENSA:\n\nContains NHS Support Agencies in England: including current organisations and\ndata for organisations that have closed in the current or previous financial\nyear. These take the form of ""Shared Services"" and ""Health Informatics\nServices"" which are formed when two or more organisations that work closely\ntogether geographically and operationally, decide to centralise and merge\ncommon services (such as Human Resources, IT or Finance Departments).\n\n**How Maintained**\n\nInformation on NHS Support Agencies is relayed to ODS via the organisations in\nquestion. Any request for a new code requires the submission of a form which\nrequires the organisation's Chief Executive signature; this acts as a means of\nverifying the existence of the organisation.

Healthy life expectancy at birth is calculated for each middle super output area and then the slope index of inequality (SII) is calculated based on these figures. The SII is a measure of the social gradient in healthy life expectancy, i.e. how much healthy life expectancy varies with deprivation. It takes account of health inequalities across the whole range of deprivation within the local authority and summarises this in a single number. This represents the range in years of healthy life expectancy across the social gradient from most to least deprived, based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between healthy life expectancy and deprivation across all middle super output areas. Healthy life expectancy is a measure of the average number of years a person would expect to live in good health based on contemporary mortality rates and prevalence of self-reported good health. The prevalence of good health is derived from responses to a question on general health in the 2011 Census. Healthy life expectancy is the average number of years a person might expect to live in ?good? health in their lifetime.","2","","c4d4f1dc-5ed2-47bd-a287-f4fb5d543e97","False","","","e747c8c1-00da-428c-a6d2-8fdcc335df07","2016-08-02T11:26:43.325368","active","0.2vi - SII in healthy life expectancy based within local authorities, based on deprivation within Middle Super Output Areas","","dataset","http://www.phoutcomes.info","","approved","2014-11-05T17:04:25.299605","## What we do\r\n\r\nWe protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities.\r\nResponsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n## We are responsible for:\r\n\r\nmaking the public healthier by encouraging discussions, advising government and supporting action by local government, the NHS and other people and organisations\r\nsupporting the public so they can protect and improve their own health\r\nprotecting the nation?s health through the national health protection service, and preparing for public health emergencies\r\nsharing our information and expertise with local authorities, industry and the NHS, to help them make improvements in the public?s health\r\nresearching, collecting and analysing data to improve our understanding of health and come up with answers to public health problems\r\nreporting on improvements in the public?s health so everyone can understand the challenge and the next steps\r\nhelping local authorities and the NHS to develop the public health system and its specialist workforce\r\n\r\n## Find out more\r\n\r\nYou can find out more on Gov.uk https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/about","c4d4f1dc-5ed2-47bd-a287-f4fb5d543e97","20141105-170425.239937phe.logo.png","True","public-health-england","1e5bf038-8fd7-4ee3-afd4-d718238dc7a3","2015-01-06T11:55:57.570551","active","Public Health England","organization"

For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life.","2","","c4d4f1dc-5ed2-47bd-a287-f4fb5d543e97","False","","","094ed817-6f55-4ac7-9d46-cf2fa3a0ce0e","2016-07-12T16:05:18.943369","active","0.2iii - Slope index of inequality in life expectancy at birth within English local authorities, based on local deprivation deciles within each area","","dataset","http://www.phoutcomes.info","","approved","2014-11-05T17:04:25.299605","## What we do\r\n\r\nWe protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing, and reduce health inequalities.\r\nResponsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n## We are responsible for:\r\n\r\nmaking the public healthier by encouraging discussions, advising government and supporting action by local government, the NHS and other people and organisations\r\nsupporting the public so they can protect and improve their own health\r\nprotecting the nation?s health through the national health protection service, and preparing for public health emergencies\r\nsharing our information and expertise with local authorities, industry and the NHS, to help them make improvements in the public?s health\r\nresearching, collecting and analysing data to improve our understanding of health and come up with answers to public health problems\r\nreporting on improvements in the public?s health so everyone can understand the challenge and the next steps\r\nhelping local authorities and the NHS to develop the public health system and its specialist workforce\r\n\r\n## Find out more\r\n\r\nYou can find out more on Gov.uk https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/about","c4d4f1dc-5ed2-47bd-a287-f4fb5d543e97","20141105-170425.239937phe.logo.png","True","public-health-england","1e5bf038-8fd7-4ee3-afd4-d718238dc7a3","2015-01-06T11:55:57.570551","active","Public Health England","organization"

The ASCOF\nHandbook of Definitions, published by the Department of Health, provides in-\ndepth information on the purpose of the framework, the construction of the\nconstituent measures, and context for their interpretation. The ASCOF is used\nboth locally and nationally to set priorities for care and support, measure\nprogress and strengthen transparency and accountability. The purpose of the\nASCOF is three-fold: ? Locally, the ASCOF supports councils to improve the\nquality of care and support. By providing robust, nationally comparable\ninformation on the outcomes and experiences of local people, the ASCOF\nsupports meaningful comparisons between councils, helping to identify\npriorities for local improvement and stimulating the sharing of learning and\nbest practice.\n\n? The ASCOF fosters greater transparency in the delivery of adult social care,\nsupporting local people to hold their council to account for the quality of\nthe services they provide. A key mechanism for this is through councils' local\naccounts, where the ASCOF is already being used as a robust evidence base to\nsupport councils' reporting of their progress and priorities to local people.\n\n? Nationally, the ASCOF measures the performance of the adult social care\nsystem as a whole and its success in delivering high-quality, personalised\ncare and support. The framework will support Ministers in discharging their\naccountability to the public and Parliament for the adult social care system\nand will inform and support national policy development.\n\nThe ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are:\n\n\- Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs.\n\n\- Delaying and reducing the need for care and support.\n\n\- Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support.\n\n\- Safeguarding adults whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting\nfrom avoidable harm.\n\nThis report provides the findings from the Adult Social Care Outcomes\nFramework (ASCOF) for the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. It is based on\nfinal data and supersedes the provisional ASCOF release in July 2014.\n\nA number of ASCOF measures are commented on in this executive summary, and a\nsummary of findings is shown in Chapter 2. Council level data, along with\nregional totals and totals for council types, for 2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12\nare available on the website of the Health and Social Care Information Centre\nand through the National Adult Social Care Intelligence Service (NASCIS). The\nlatest ASCOF data can also be found on the HSCIC ASCOF website, link below.\n\n2013-14 is the first year to include measure 1I (proportion of people who use\nservices and their carers who reported that they had as much social contact as\nthey would like). Data underpinning this measure have been published for years\nprior to 2013-14 in the Adult Social Care Survey and Carers' Survey\npublications.\n\nPlease note: on 14 January 2015 the 'Time-series of aggregated outcome\nmeasures' annex for this publication has been replaced in order to correct the\n'Base' column headings for Measure 1B. The HSCIC would like to apologise for\nany inconvenience caused.\n\nASCOF Indicator 1J\n\nThe existing ASCOF Indicator 1A (Social Care related Quality of Life) tells us\nabout the current (care-related) quality of life of people using social care.\nFollowing discussions in 2011 at the Outcomes and Information Development\nBoard (OIDB), it was agreed that the Department of Health would commission a\nresearch project from the Quality and Outcomes of Person Centred Care Policy\nResearch Unit (QORU) to develop a 'value added' measure of social care-related\nquality of life.? This indicator, to be known as ASCOF Indicator 1J, will form\npart of the 2016-17 framework to be published shortly by the Department of\nHealth.\n\nThe summary paper provided below (IIASC Report Summary 2013-14)?therefore\nseeks to describe: the background, methods and results of the QORU study which\nproduced the calculation needed in constructing this new indicator; the\napplication of this calculation to existing data flows to derive aggregate\nlocal authority-level data; and the interpretation of these individual and\naggregate measures, again drawing on the QORU study.? Additionally, local\nauthority-level data (based on the 2013-14 Adult Social Care Survey\nsubmissions) are provided in the accompanying dataset (IIASC Dataset 2013-14)\nand it is envisaged that similar datasets will be made available in due course\nto cover 2014-15 and 2015-16.\n\nFor further details, QORU's papers detailing the conclusions of the research\nand development phase of their work can be found via the 'Related links'\nsection?below.? Any queries or comments should be directed to\nascof@dh.gsi.gov.uk in the first instance.\n\n","10","","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","False","","","94a5f4e0-41e1-4dcb-b38c-2ce66ee8d7b3","2016-03-23T13:22:18.479606","active","ASCOF - Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework, England -2013-14","","dataset","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/article/2021/Website-Search?productid=16655&q=Measures+from+the+Adult+Social+Care+Outcomes+Framework%2c+England+Final&sort=Relevance&size=100&page=1&area=both#top","","approved","2014-10-27T16:08:10.376328","The national provider of information, data and IT systems for health and social care.","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hscic/images/toplogo.gif","True","hscic","8fe5808c-cd82-4e0a-a374-ef75130983e0","2016-08-18T11:43:59.491927","active","NHS Digital","organization"

This structure was\nintroduced following the Review of Public Administration (RPA) in Northern\nIreland and formally came into effect on 1 April 2009. The five Local\nCommissioning Groups (LCGs) are committees of the Health and Social Care Board\nand are responsible for the commissioning of health and social care of their\nlocal population. Each LCG is co-terminus with their respective Health and\nSocial Care Trust area. There are five trusts in Northern Ireland providing\nhealth and social care services to the Northern Ireland public.

This\npublication presents a wide range of information about care delivered to users\nof NHS funded secondary mental health and learning disability services in\nEngland.\n\nThe scope of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) was extended to cover\nLearning Disability services from September 2014.? Many people who have a\nlearning disability use mental health services and people in learning\ndisability services may have a mental health problem. This means that activity\nincluded in the new MHLDDS dataset cannot be distinctly divided into mental\nhealth or learning disability spells of care - a single spell of care may\ninclude inputs from either of both types of service.? We will be working with\nstakeholders to define specific information and reporting requirements\nrelating to specific services or groups of patients.\n\nFour new measures have been added to this release to help with interpretation\nof the data.

This report is\nbased on submissions made to the Mental Health Minimum Dataset (MHMDS) between\nApril 2013 and March 2014. These submissions were made using version 4.1 of\nthe MHMDS, which was mandated in April 2013 as a monthly submission for the\nfirst time. This report also uses mid-year population estimates (2013) from\nthe Office for National Statistics.\n\nFor consistency, much of the information produced in this report and reference\ntables are updates to those produced in last year's publication, allowing the\nreader to compare this year's data to previous years. However, to reflect the\nchanges to NHS commissioning structures, we have replaced our Primary Care\nTrust (PCT) level analysis with Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level\nanalysis. This means that no time series information is available at CCG level\nas 2013/14 was the first year these organisations became operational.\n\nTime series have been maintained at a high level within our reference tables,\nbut in many places have been limited to 2011-12 as the earliest data point.\nThis is because significant changes were made to the MHMDS in this year\n(moving from version 3.5 to version 4.0) which means that information before\nthis is not directly comparable.\n\nDemographic analysis (age, gender and ethnicity) is presented for 2013-14 only\nwhere numbers allow. The reader is advised to consult previous publications\n(as appropriate) for historical data.\n\nTo prevent the release of disclosive information, numbers less than five\n(including zero) are replaced with by a ""*"" symbol. All other numbers are\nrounded to the nearest five, apart from the England totals which are\nunrounded. Calculated values are based on unrounded numbers but rounded to 1\ndecimal place to prevent backward calculation. This approach will prevent\nidentification of a person through cross referencing different publications.\n\nMonthly analyses and associated data quality measures for 2013-14 have already\nbeen released as monthly publications.?

The report also uses the latest population figures from\nthe 2011 census.\n\nThis report therefore contains a reduced set of time series analyses and\neffectively presents a new baseline for some established measures,\nparticularly those relating to people only in contact with community services.\n\nFor operational reasons the 2011/12 Bulletin has been published in two parts.\nThe initial publication on February 19th 2013 contained a report and data\ntables based on national figures. This second release on 30th April 2013 adds\norganisational level analysis and a machine readable file of underlying data\nfor some useful measures. It also introduces standardised rates of access at\nPrimary Care Trust (PCT) level to specialist mental health services, based on\n2011 Census data.\n\nThe Bulletin is intended to be useful to stakeholders (e.g. the Department of\nHealth and service commissioners), data providers and users of our statistics\n(e.g. mental health organisations including charities, and service users and\ntheir representatives).\n\nIMPORTANT: In March 2013 we made some improvements to calculations and derived\ndata items and the way in which time series were presented.

On 30 March 2012, the ASCOF for 2012-13 was\npublished by the Department of Health. The purpose of the ASCOF is three-fold:\n\n\- Nationally, the ASCOF aims to give an indication of the strengths and\nweaknesses of social care in delivering better outcomes for people who use\nservices.\n\n\- Locally, one of the key intended uses of the ASCOF is to support councils\nto improve the services they provide. The framework attempts to support\nmeaningful comparisons between councils, based on the outcomes they deliver\nfor local people, and to help stimulate the sharing of learning and\ndiscussions on best practice.\n\n\- It is intended that the ASCOF will foster greater transparency in the\ndelivery of adult social care, supporting local people to hold their council\nto account for the quality of the services they provide.\n\nThe ASCOF encompasses four domains. These are:\n\n\- Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs.\n\n\- Delaying and reducing the need for care and support.\n\n\- Ensuring people have a positive experience of care and support.\n\n\- Safeguarding people whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting\nthem from avoidable harm.\n\nThis report contains the final figures for all of the 2012-13 ASCOF measures\nfor England. It supersedes the provisional ASCOF release in July 2013 and\nprovides further information to the initial findings on final data published\nin November 2013.\n\nA selection of ASCOF measures is commented on in this executive summary. The\n2012-13 national values for all the measures are shown in a table in Chapter 2\nalong with comparisons with 2010-11 and 2011-12, where available. Council\nlevel time-series data for 2010-11 to 2012-13 are available on the website of\nthe Health and Social Care Information Centre and through the National Adult\nSocial Care Intelligence Service (NASCIS). The data are available in CSV\nformat. The latest ASCOF data can also be found via the new HSCIC ASCOF\nwebsite. Links to NASCIS and the ASCOF website are provided in the resources\nsection of this web page.\n\nAll changes to outcomes based on survey data that are commented on in the key\nfacts section of this web page are statistically significant.\n\n2012-13 is the first year for which measures based on the Personal Social\nServices Survey of Adult Carers in England (Carers' Survey) are included.\n\nPlease note: on 14 January 2015 the 'Time-series of aggregated outcome\nmeasures' annex for this publication has been replaced in order to correct the\n'Base' column headings for Measure 1B. The HSCIC would like to apologise for\nany inconvenience caused.\n\nPlease note: on 16 December 2014 the report and annex tables for this\npublication have been updated. This was done in order to correct a number of\nmargin of error (confidence intervals) figures for ASCOF outcomes 3B, 3C and\n3D that had previously been incorrect. Users are advised to download these\nrevised annexes to ensure they have the best available data. The HSCIC would\nlike to apologise for any inconvenience caused.\n\nPlease note: on 04 August 2014 the disaggregated data for Measure 4A 'The\nproportion of people who use services who feel safe' for this publication have\nbeen updated (details below):\n\n?-?In the 'Disaggregated annex' sheet 4a (rounded) the regional and council type totals for the '18 to 64' breakdown (cell range K165:M179) have been corrected.

The data available for downloading includes:\n\n  * Hospital Consultants in England (file econcur) \n  * Dental Consultants in England (file edconcur)\nHospital and Dental Consultant information is provided once a month by the\nHealth and Social Care Information Centre (IC). The data is collated from an\nextract drawn from the Electronic Staff Record system (ESR). Users should\nnote:\n\n  * As the extract is sourced from ESR, it will not include any consultants working for an organisation that does not use the system. This limits the extracts to a number of organisation types: SHAs, NHS Trusts, PCTs, Care Trusts and Special Health Authorities \n  * Two NHS Trusts have opted out of ESR and so information on their consultants continues to be sourced from the yearly census: RFS (Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) and RP6 (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). Users should note that information on consultants employed at these two organisations will continue to be less frequently updated.\n\nThe Hospital Consultant codes are based on the practitioner's GMC code, to\nwhich a prefix of 'C' is added. The General Medical Council (GMC) is the\nregulating body for doctors, and holds a record of all doctors who are\nregistered to practice in the UK. They allocate each of these doctors a unique\ncode (GMC code). ALL doctors must be registered with the GMC to practice and\nwill therefore have a GMC code. The Dental Consultant codes are based on the\npractitioner's GDC code to which a prefix of 'CD' is added. The General Dental\nCouncil (GDC) is the regulatory body for the dental profession in the UK. As\nwith the GMC they allocate each registered professional a unique registration\nnumber (GDC Code). ALL dental practitioners must be registered with the GDC\nand will therefore have a GDC code. Many consultants working in a dental\nspecialty are also qualified doctors, and therefore have a GMC code in\naddition to their GDC code. In these cases the GMC takes precedence and the\nconsultants are included in the hospital consultant file only. There are some\ndental consultants however, who do not have a GMC code. They are qualified\npurely in their dental specialty and only have a GDC code. These consultants\nwill only appear in the Dental Consultant file. Consultant Codes are for\nidentifying practitioner's work as a Consultant ONLY. Whenever a code is\nrequired to identify a GP or a dentist working in practice, the appropriate\nGeneral Practitioner code (supplied by the NHS Prescription Service, of the\nNHS Business Services Authority), Dental Practitioner code (supplied by the\nNHS Dental Service, of the NHS Business Services Authority) or equivalent\ndefault code must be used. The General Practitioner and Dental Practitioner\ncodes are both available to download from this site. Please note: Hospital\nConsultants in Wales (file wconcur) were previously extracted by the Health\nand Social Care Information Centre from returns in the Annual Census of\nMedical and Dental Staff. Unfortunately changes to the way the Annual Census\nis now obtained means that it is no longer possible to collect the Welsh data\nand we are currently unable to obtain this information from another source.

Patients' self-reported health status (sometimes referred to as health related quality of life) is assessed through a mixture of generic and disease or condition-specific questions. To add to the value of the PROMs questionnaire data, it is linked routinely with HES episode-level information.\n\nA list of all of the items in the PROMs dataset is included in the PROMS Data Dictionary and the PROMs website provides a guide to methodology.

The concept of 'amenable' mortality generally relates to deaths under age 75, due to the difficulty in determining cause of death in older people who often have multiple morbidities. The Office for National Sta tistics (ONS) produces mortality data by cause, which excludes deaths under 28 days (for which cause of death is not classified by ICD - 10 codes). These indicators therefore relate to deaths between 28 days and 74 years of age inclusive.\n\nONS consulted on a proposed list of causes considered amenable to healthcare in February 2011 and updated the list in April 2012.

Quantitative data from the NRLS should only be used as an indicator of reporting culture, not as actual harm, as all incident reporting systems are affected by under-reporting. Whilst high reporting rates are difficult to interpret ? they may reflect a good reporting culture or a higher level of incidents that need reporting - significantly lower overall reporting rates than similar organisations and implausibly low rates of reporting of death and severe harm incidents can indicate a provider where harm and potential harm is not recognised or where staff feel reporting is not encouraged or worthwhile. Organisations which have improved safety to a greater degree than similar organisations and/or do more to make their staff believe reporting is encouraged and worthwhile are likely to see a higher proportion of their incidents reported as ?no harm? but only local exploration of the actual reported incidents can confirm this is the case.\r\n\r\nNational Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) data describes the number of patient safety incidents (?any incident that could have, or did, harm a patient receiving NHS funded care?) that have been reported.\r\n\r\nThe majority (over 99%) of the incidents in the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) are uploaded from local risk management systems (such as Datix or Ulysses) provided by NHS trusts and other types of providers of NHS funded care (for example pharmacy chains and social enterprises providing community healthcare). These incidents would either have been directly entered on local risk management systems by local staff, or, in a decreasing minority of providers, reported on paper forms that are later input to local risk management systems by administrative staff in the local provider. The reported incidents may include incidents that have occurred in other services but have been recognised by the provider  reporting the incident. Less than 1% of incidents are directly reported by eForm, either because the person reporting the incident does not want to report via standard local systems, or, more commonly, because they work for a small provider such as a GP practice that does not have a local incident management system. providers are required to upload to the NRLS at least monthly, and should report death and severe harm incidents within two working days of becoming aware of them.\r\n\r\nThe National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) data are presented in a table per provider, where rows represent reported levels of severity with the no harm, low harm, moderate harm, severe harm and death defined in http://www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/collections/seven-steps-to-patient-safety/ and columns represent the calendar month in which the incidents were reported to the NRLS (this may not be the same month as when the incident occurred, depending on how promptly the provider uploads their incidents to the NRLS). Whilst providers who upload data to the NRLS are expected to check data quality, the reported harm can reflect incorrect severity selection on the part of frontline reporter.","7","","ec6be5ca-9ab5-49d1-896c-d1afa7aa3557","True","","","37cf955c-553a-49cc-b5cc-8937e211704f","2015-01-26T15:23:18.333172","active","NHS England Dashboard","","dataset","http://www.nrls.nhs.uk","","approved","2014-12-02T14:17:19.243234","The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) is a central database of patient safety incident reports.

It usually results from the combination of weak bone structure (osteoporosis) and a fall. Around 76,000 hip fractures occur each year in the UK as a whole.

It  documents case-mix, care and outcomes of hip fracture patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and is now, with more than 250,000 cases on record ? by far the largest hip fracture audit in the world.\r\n\r\nIt has demonstrated broad improvements at local and national level in patient care, and in England has supported the Department of Health?s highly successful Best Practice Tariff for hip fracture care. The work of the NHFD is now being replicated in Ireland, with the recent launch of Irish Hip Fracture Database, and similar developments are in hand in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong.\r\nThe National Hip Fracture Database was founded as a collaboration between the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Geriatrics Society.

The data will be available in a pdf format in the National Lung Cancer Audit 2011 annual report. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\nMeasures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThe data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields; These data do not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nData are analysed either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2011. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not routinely supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by 'place first seen' and cancer networks. The ?place first seen' most closely represents the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs). \r\n\r\nWe largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator' for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year two files of data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the NLCA and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for lung cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in appendix 2 of the NLCA report. \r\n\r\nAre all Trusts included? \r\n\r\nAll Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma are included. \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data were extracted from the NLCA database in July 2012 and covers patients first seen in the calendar year 2011.

The scores for 8 separate components of organisation each range from 0 to 100 with 100 being the  optimal score.  A total organisational score is obtained by calculating the average of the 8 domain scores.   The 25% of hospitals with the best stroke care organisation are in the upper quartile, the least well organised 25% of hospitals are in the lower quartile.  The middle half lie between the two. NB the quartile position is based on the performance of 190 participating sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe table of named hospital results should be read in context as part of the full SSNAP Acute Organisational Audit Report 2012 which can be downloaded below and the full audit questions (appendix 2 of the full report).\r\n\r\nThis full report enables the organisation of stroke services at national level to be compared with national standards outlined in the fourth edition of the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke (2012) published by the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party and the NICE Clinical Guideline, the National Stroke Strategy 2007 and the NICE Quality Standard for Stroke (2010).   \r\n","11","","48d81c55-57de-4cb0-8fd5-d34ea4dacf1b","False","","","b2c9609f-b766-4445-bf52-36d6b3de4563","2015-01-09T16:22:35.199335","active","Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) - Acute Organisational Audit 2012","","dataset","","","approved","2015-01-09T15:48:12.945247","The Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) is led by a consortium of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Royal College of Nursing and National Voices.

SSNAP also collects outcome measures at 6 months. The aim is to improve the quality of stroke care by auditing stroke services against evidence based standards. \r\n\r\nThe latest SSNAP quarterly report presents national and named team results for the entire inpatient stroke care pathway.   It is based on 18,839 patients admitted to and 17,503 patients discharged from hospital between 1 October and 31 December 2013.  \r\n\r\nThis report contains results for important measures of inpatient stroke care including stroke unit care, thrombolysis, therapy assessments and intensity, timings of interventions, and discharge standards.  It also provides comparisons where appropriate against the previous 3 quarterly reports to show changes over time.\r\n\r\nA SSNAP scoring system has been derived to enable hospitals to compare their performance against other hospitals and benchmark against the national result.  This summary of performance is based upon results for 44 key indicators which are grouped into 10 domains covering key aspects of stroke care.   An overall score is calculated from domain scores adjusted for case ascertainment and audit compliance. Please see technical guidance for details about how the SSNAP scores are calculated.\r\n\r\nNo hospital in England or Wales has achieved the top overall performance level this quarter. This is because extremely high standards have been set with the aim of stimulating hospitals to identify where improvements are needed and drive change.   Nowhere else in the world has set as stringent standards and the results should be read in this context.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInteractive Maps \r\nThese dynamic maps allow you to find information about stroke services for your local provider. You can compare different standards of care within your team, and compare your local provider to other providers and against regional and national averages.\r\n \r\nThe maps present SSNAP results for 44 key indicators, 10 domains and overall SSNAP level.  \r\n\r\nSSNAP Summary Results \r\nThis excel file contains summary information by named team for 44 key indicators within 10 domains of care in addition to measures of overall performance based on the SSNAP scoring system\r\n\r\nPublic Report (PDF)\r\nThis includes national level figures for the entire stroke pathway for important stroke standards and indicators, key recommendations, clinical commentary, and changes over time. Section 1 is a summary overview based on important domains of stroke care each of which is comprised of a number of key indicators and case ascertainment and audit compliance scores. This report also contains named team results in the form of a colour coded table (Section 8).\r\n\r\nThis full report enables the quality of stroke care at national level to be compared with national standards outlined in the fourth edition of the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke (2012) published by the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party and the NICE Clinical Guideline, the National Stroke Strategy 2007 and the NICE Quality Standard for Stroke (2010).   \r\n\r\nFull Results Portfolio\r\nThis is a very detailed file containing results for every stroke measure collected by SSNAP.

The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) was identified as the pilot for this data release. \r\n\r\nThe data was released in an open and standardised format for the first time in December 2011, and each year onward, data from the National Lung Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. The data are also being made available on the data.gov website.\r\n\r\nCovering all Cancer Networks and NHS Trusts in England, the data from the audit includes information about data completeness, audit process and outcome measures. The data will be available in a pdf format with the National Lung Cancer Audit 2012 annual report. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\nMeasures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThe data also provides Audit participation by Trust and data completeness for the key fields. This data does not list data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Lung Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nData is analysed either by cancer network or by place first seen in secondary care for the calendar year 2012. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not routinely supply diagnostic data are not properly represented in these data. This is because all the analyses of the NLCA to date have been carried out by 'place first seen' and cancer networks. The ?place first seen' most closely represents the Clinical Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) which makes the first treatment decisions (in partnership with representatives from the specialist centres who sit on these peripheral MDTs). \r\n\r\nWe largely know the population base for these MDTs and that number provides the ?denominator' for the outcome measures. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. So taking the raw data at face value gives a very distorted picture both of their activity and performance. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website.

See link to latest data using new methodology, which explains the difference:\n\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cancer-unit/cancer-survival/2006---2010--followed-up-to-2011/stb-cancer-survival.html\n\nClinical rationale\n==================\n\nReduced years of life lost from cancer\n\nData source\n===========\n\nONS: mortality data by cause (England and Wales):\n\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/mortality-statistics-deaths-registered-in-england-and-wales-series-dr-/2010/dr-table5-2010.xls\n\nONS: mid-year population estimates:\n\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-231847\n\nand\n\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-england-and-wales/index.html\n\nONS: cancer registrations data:\n\nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/cancer-statistics-registrations-england-series-mb1-/no-41-2010/rft-cancer-registrations-2010.xls\n\nCalculation\n===========\n\nCalculated rates provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\n\nSource: http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ccg-ois-1415-tech-guid.pdf.","4","","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","False","","","f7bf2645-bb90-4789-a674-dca96d9462e1","2015-01-08T12:01:00.645983","active","CCGOIS - 1.10 One year survival from all cancers","","dataset","https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/","","approved","2014-10-27T16:08:10.376328","The national provider of information, data and IT systems for health and social care.","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hscic/images/toplogo.gif","True","hscic","8fe5808c-cd82-4e0a-a374-ef75130983e0","2016-08-18T11:43:59.491927","active","NHS Digital","organization"

Main changes to the QOF at the start\nof 2012/13 included the retirement of seven indicators (including five from\nthe Quality and Productivity area), releasing 45 points to fund new and\nreplacement indicators; the introduction of nine new NICE recommended clinical\nindicators, including two new clinical areas (PAD and Osteoporosis) and\nadditional smoking indicators; the introduction of three new organisational\nindicators for improving Quality and Productivity which focus on accident and\nemergency attendances; ? sixteen other indicators were replaced, either due to\nchanges to indicator wording or coding/business logic changes or to changes to\npoint values or thresholds. Overall, the maximum QOF score remained at 1,000\npoints.\n\n","11","","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","False","","","75ec4e86-4e82-4cac-8647-f962f0208378","2015-01-07T17:57:00.474134","active","QOF - National Quality Outcomes Framework - 2012-13","","dataset","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/pubs/qofachprevexcoct13","","approved","2014-10-27T16:08:10.376328","The national provider of information, data and IT systems for health and social care.","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hscic/images/toplogo.gif","True","hscic","8fe5808c-cd82-4e0a-a374-ef75130983e0","2016-08-18T11:43:59.491927","active","NHS Digital","organization"

Participation rates are very high, with most\nPersonal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part. Practices score\npoints on the basis of achievement against each indicator, up to a maximum of\n1,000 points. Results of GP practices' achievement against the QOF are\npublished each year.\n\nThe QOF is not about performance management, but incentivising and rewarding\ngood practice. For 2011/12, 8,123 GP practices in England are included in the\npublished results, covering almost 100 per cent of registered patients in\nEngland.\n\nThe QOF has four main components, known as domains. Each domain consists of a\nset of measures of achievement, known as indicators, against which practices\nscore points according to their level of achievement.\n\nClinical domain: 87 indicators across 20 clinical areas (e.g. coronary heart\ndisease, heart failure, hypertension).\n\nOrganisational domain: 45 indicators across six organisational areas - records\nand information; information for patients; education and training; practice\nmanagement and medicines management.\n\nPatient care experience domain: one indicator relating to length of\nconsultations.\n\nAdditional services domain: nine indicators across four service areas\n(cervical screening, child health surveillance, maternity services and\ncontraceptive services)\n\nHow is QOF achievement measured?\n\nAchievement against the QOF is measured by the Quality Management Analysis\nSystem (QMAS), a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health\n(CfH). QMAS ensures consistency in the calculation of quality achievement and\ndisease prevalence, and is linked to payment systems. QOF information on QMAS\nis not a comprehensive source of data on quality of care in general practice,\nbut it is potentially a rich and valuable source of such information,\nproviding the limitations of the data are acknowledged.\n\nThe Prescribing and Primary Care team of The NHS Information Centre works on\nbehalf of the Department of Health and in collaboration with CfH to obtain\nextracts from QMAS to support the publication of the QOF information.\n\nFurther details on how the QOF is measured (e.g. QMAS system; practice list\nsize, patient exceptions etc) can be found in the QOF 2011/12 bulletin.\n\n","159","","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","False","","","5c4a5e6a-b66a-47dd-8033-a9371acbe9b5","2015-01-07T17:04:52.489918","active","QOF - National Quality Outcomes Framework - 2011-12","","dataset","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/qofexcep1112","","approved","2014-10-27T16:08:10.376328","The national provider of information, data and IT systems for health and social care.","d3f093ab-b8a1-4d3f-bf84-901d7cb0482b","http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hscic/images/toplogo.gif","True","hscic","8fe5808c-cd82-4e0a-a374-ef75130983e0","2016-08-18T11:43:59.491927","active","NHS Digital","organization"
